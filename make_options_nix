# DoomLegacy Make options for Linux, FreeBSD
# See README_compiling.txt
# Edit for OS, SMIF, and other compile options.
#
MAKE_OPTIONS_PRESENT=1

# Select an OS: LINUX FREEBSD
#  Linux works for all other *nix platforms, as far as we know.
#  FreeBSD requires differences in the Makefile and code.
OS=LINUX

# Select a draw library:
#  SDL: the SDL library is recommended and is the best maintained interface
#  LINUX_X11: LINUX X11 native drawing
#  FREEBSD_X11: FreeBSD X11 native drawing
SMIF=SDL

# SDL_Mixer library is a separate library from SDL
HAVE_MIXER=1

# Put other options here, see the src/Makefile or README_compiling.
# Compiler select: GCC MINGW WATCOM CLANG
# CC_SELECT=GCC
# Enable CC_ENVIRONMENT to use the environment CC var.
# CC_ENVIRONMENT=1
# CC_EXPLICIT=clang

# Architecture custom compile will result in faster smaller code,
# but will not execute on incompatible machines.
# Any valid value for -march= on your compiler may be set here.
# For more information, ask your compiler.
# > gcc --target-help
# GCC info says to use -march, as -mcpu now is same as -mtune.
# Switch -mtune does not select instruction set, only arranges better.
# The default for GCC may be generic or i386.
# generic32, generic64, i386, i486, i586, i686
# pentium4, prescott, core, core2, athlon, k6, k8, amdfam10, etc.
# + mmx, sse, sse2, sse3, sse4, 3dnow
# Examples:
# ARCH=-march=i386
# ARCH=-march=i486+sse2
# ARCH=-march=i686 -mtune=athlon -msse -mno-sse4 -m64
# Let the compiler detect your hardware.
# ARCH=-march=native

# For PowerPC: 401, 403, 630, 740, 7400, 7450, 8540, power7, G5, etc.
# GCC info only uses -mcpu for powerpc, dont know if -march will work.
# ARCH=-mcpu=630 -m64
# ARCH=-mcpu=G5 -maltivec -mabi=altivec

# To enable debug code, with no fullscreen.
# DEBUG=1

# Might not have the CD music libraries.
# CD_MUSIC=0

# Have openserver and unixwave sound options.
# Music options: none
#   SCOOS5: openserver5
#   SCOUW2: unixware2
#   SCOUW7: unixware7
# MUS_OS=
# Have Esound on Linux native X11. Not needed for SDL.
# HAVE_ESD=1

# Linux or FreeBSD X11 GGI video interface libs.
# X11_GGI=1

# Uncomment if you want to use the POLL_POINTER hack in X11.
# POLL_POINTER=-DPOLL_POINTER

# If you have a slow computer you may want to try assembly, but the
# assembly code is not often updated with the latest improvements.
# USEASM=1
