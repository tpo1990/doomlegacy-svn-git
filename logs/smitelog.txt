Doom Legacy 1.x
Started: 2010-02-07

*** Initial SVN import
rev 1, 2009-09-23
  * Initial SVN import from CVS module doomlegacy
  * Bump version number to 1.44


*** OLDWATER removal
rev 596, 597
OLDWATER was an attempt at implementing realistic water using negative
sector tag values (-tag == water height). It used values 888 and 887
in the player_t::specialsector field to denote negative tag- and floor
flat image -based water content, respectively. It also used
visplane_t::picnum value 1998 to denote a water plane.

Removed completely, as we now have better methods for creating water.


*** Added this log
rev 598


*** Makefile cleanup
rev 604
Replaced all the separate multimedia interface options by one option, IF,
which defaults to SDL. Removed unnecessary defines DIRECTFULLSCREEN, VID_X11.
Also: Removed some old unused endianness code, small bugfix in p_floor.c.


*** Fixing the savegame system
rev 605, 606
Replaced the hack used for saving and loading mobj_t pointers, the new system
should be 64-bit safe. The savegame files are not yet platform-independent
since the memcpy-based saving system does not take care of endianness.
FS save/load should work also, including FS arrays.

Fixed handling of active plats, now stopped plats should stay stopped
when loading.


*** vsprintf fixes
rev 608
Replaced a number of unsafe uses of vsprintf with vsnprintf, fixing
several console-related crashing bugs. There may be more of the same
in the interface code (SDL and OpenGL are clean).


*** The great compiler warning cleanup
rev 609, 610
Fixed a LOT of compiler warnings. Now the 64-bit version compiles cleanly.
There were lots of questionable pointer hacks in the code, some of which still remain.
Also backported some stuff to tables.h and tables.c from Legacy2.


*** Small z_zone changes
rev 635
ZONEID is now the first field in memblock_t so that it'll be the first
field to be corrupted by an overflow in the preceding block(s).
Replaced all if(block->user > 0x100) tests by if(block->user).


*** Game modes, commandline switches
rev 636
GDESC system now recognizes Strife, will abort if an unsupported game
is run (currently Hexen or Strife).
Added support for the standard --version and --help commandline switches.


*** ENDOOM fixed
rev 688
Now the ENDOOM lump has current information in it. Also created a new
directory, resources, for legacy.wad lumps.


*** Documentation cleanup/update
rev 692
Removed obsolete docs:
  doomlic.txt (old, non-GPL Doom licence)
  sound.cfg (Allegro configuration file?)
  Doublescan.txt (ancient configuration info for XFree86)
  README_SDL (obsolete caveats for version 1.40 SDL)
Readme.OS2 moved to os2/ directory.
Updated source.html.


*** Warnings fixed
rev 699
Fixed a number of warnings in p_saveg.c and one in p_hsight.c
Use id/pointer unions when loading mobj*'s from a savegame instead of
cast hacks to be 64-bit safe.


*** Backported international keyboard support from Legacy 2
rev 700, 752
Now we support arbitrary keyboard layouts via SDL (only ASCII chars,
though), and use SDL keycodes internally.
Removed some redundant code from console.c and hu_stuff.c
Moved all SDL input handling to sdl/i_system.c


*** New legacy.wad resources, FS fixes, updated FS docs
rev 702, 703
Added the WAD inventory and updated VERSION and THINGS.H lumps.
Small FS fixes in the new funcs introduced after 1.42.
Fixed and partially updated _doc/fsfuncs.html.


*** Backported SDL joystick code from Legacy 2
rev 714
Input handling is much cleaner now, but could still be better.
Linux-specific joystick code removed from sdl/.


*** Simplified SDL audio/music startup/shutdown
rev 724
Sound and music are now initialized and shut down simultaneously.
Also fixed an improper call to SDL_Init in sdl/i_cdmus.c


*** Removed FMOD/digmusic references from the music interface
rev 725
Since not every platform uses FMOD (SDL version doesn't need it, for
example) it should not be explicitly mentioned in the music interface.
Also removed the -digmusic switch.


*** SDL sound fixes, raised audio output samplerate to 22 kHz
rev 730
Removed unnecessary code and unwarranted assumptions, fixed a possible
buffer overflow. Now my sound works again :)


*** Renamed consvars and commands
rev 733
Some of the console vars and commands have really confusing names
right now, so a little renaming is in order. To be continued.


*** Preparing for 1.44 alpha1
rev 736, 737
Small beautification fixes.
Renamed legacy.dat to legacy.wad (since it is a WAD file).


*** Windows/SDL fixes
rev 743, 744
The __WIN32__ macro was used in lots of conditionals for things specific
to the WinAPI version, yet they are unapplicable to the Windows/SDL
version. Replaced them with the macro WIN_NATIVE_PLACEHOLDER if we
ever need a Windows/WinAPI version.
Likewise, removed lots of inappropriate uses of the LINUX macro (which
actually means "UNIX-like"...)
Removed VID_PrepareModeList from the video interface, it doesn't need to be exposed.
Modified the Makefile to include a platform option, Linux/SDL and
Windows/SDL both compile and link.


*** Fuzzymode consvar
rev 745
Added a consvar for choosing between the original (fuzziness) and new
(transparency) partial invisibility effect.


*** System interface fixes, improved SDL_mixer music.
rev 754
Fixed I_GetFreeMem and I_GetDiskFreeSpace for Windows.
Now we can actually pause and resume the music using SDL_mixer.
All music loops by default. Fixed a potential bug where non-looping
music wasn't played at all.


*** Mouse consvars and menu items renamed.
rev 760
Confusingly named mouse sensitivity consvars and menu items renamed.


*** FS fixes
rev 798
FS documentation updated, Spider Mastermind name in THINGS.H fixed.


*** Menu bug fixed
rev 811
Bug 3078853: Non-character keys should not initiate an alphaKey search.
Also now draws disabled small text menuitems in white (gamma).


*** Added backslash escapes to command parser
rev 812
Bug 3159614: Command parser could not handle nested quotes, now they
can be backslash-escaped.
Manual updated.


*** Signed fields in map structs changed to unsigned to accommodate larger maps
rev 823
Bug 3170768: blowup.wad overflowed signed map structures.
Fixed by making them unsigned.


*** CFG files amnesia bug fixed
rev 827
Bug 653278: Netvars loaded from config file have no effect.
Solution: Do not try to change cvars through the XCmd interface unless
we are in a netgame, do it directly instead.


*** Input bugfixes, cleanup
rev 828
Restored localaiming pitch angle clipping.
Fixed mousewheel functionality by adding the gamekeytapped array
 (mouse wheel events are virtual keys which are depressed and immediately released).
Cleaned up some game messages, Makefile.


*** Bugfixes, docs updated.
rev 841
Apparently harmless buffer overflow bug fixed in w_wad.c.
Splitscreen now works again, rev 827 introduced a bug in which
 non-netvar cvars could not be changed in netgames.
Docs fixed/beautified.


*** 1.44 alpha3 release
rev 845
Updated version to 1.44 alpha3.


*** CMake build system
rev 1077
Added CMakeLists.txt files for building Legacy using CMake.
Cross compilation does not work yet.


*** Updated version to 1.45.0 beta1
rev 1078


*** Source tree reorganization
rev 1110-1113
Source code went into trunk/src/, now the build happens entirely inside trunk/.
Removed some unnecessary files, created necessary ones.
Makefile has not been fixed yet.
