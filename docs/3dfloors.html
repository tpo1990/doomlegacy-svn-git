<h1>3D Floors Tutorial</h1>

<div class="column">

<p>Ok, you want to put a 3D floor into your level?</p>

<p>
First, I want you to understand that I am not here to 
teach anyone how to use their editor of choice.
You need to understand how to tag a line to a sector 
and how to set a linedef type.
Please view the <a href="tutorial.html">Map Editing Tutorial</a> 
for more info.
</p>

<p>Let's get started.</p>

<p>First, build a small, 5 sector level to match the example 
image. Screenshots re-taken in Doom Builder. heh</p>

<p>

</p>
<p>
Sectors A and B should have a floor height of 128, a ceiling height of 
256, and a light level of 176. Sectors C, D, and E, should have a ceiling 
height of 256, a floor height of 0, a light level of 255 and make the 
floor texture something painful (like lava or nukage).
</p>

<p>
Now, texture everything in and add a player start to 
your map if you would like to test out what you've made so far.
It should look something like this:
</p>

<p><img src="images/exp0.png" width="352" height="213" alt="" /></p>

<p>
OK, so now we need a bridge across the lava. Now we could just raise 
the floor of sector C to accommodate our marine. However, this method 
of creating a bridge really sucks because it doesn't allow for a passage 
UNDER the bridge, so we are going to create a 3D bridge to get us
across.
</p>

<p>
First, we need to make a control sector. This is a small, off map sector 
that will contain the textures and attributes we'll need to make a 3D 
structure. The size and shape of this sector does not matter.
</p>

<p>
NOTE: I usually make my control sectors a triangle and "point" them at 
whatever they effect. It makes them easier to keep track of.
</p>

<p><img src="images/exp2.png" width="353" height="213" alt="" /></p>
<p>
Now set sector F's floor height to 112 and it's ceiling height to 128, 
and set both floor and ceiling textures to RROCK11, and set F's light 
level to 176.
</p>

<p>
Then, select one of the linedefs, set the line special to <b>281</b>
(281 is the linedef code for a solid, opaque, 3D floor) and tag it to 
sector C.</p>
<p>
Now sector F will be a "model" for a 3D floor in sector C. Sector F's 
floor will be the model for the "bottom" of the 3D floor, and it's height 
and texture will be used accordingly.</p>

<p><img src="images/exp3.png" width="352" height="211" alt="" /></p>
<p>
The same applies for the ceiling of sector F, it's ceiling texture and 
height will be used. The texture for the "sides" of the 3D floor will 
be the middle texture of the linedef with the 281 special.</p>

<p>
(I used BSTONE1 for the wall texture) and finally, the light level 
of sector F will be the light of the shadow it casts.</p>

<p>What's left? Nothing! Run j00r map!</p>
