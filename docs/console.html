Make sure you read this, you will discover a lot of goodies available
in Legacy! Be a Doom power user!<br/>
Skip to <a href="#reference">section 2</a> and browse through the list of commands if you're
in a hurry!
</p>


<h2 id="basics">Console basics</h2>

<h3 id="usage">Console usage</h3>

<p>With the DoomLegacy console, you will be able to change most of the game
parameters from within the game, and customise it to your preferences.
The console is simply a command prompt, where you can enter commands
and change the values of game variables.
The first game console we know of was from id Software's game Quake.
We have been inspired by it and have tried to implement the same
functionality for the benefit of Quake/Doom fans.
</p>

<p>To open the console, press the <b>console key</b>.
The default console key is the accent key located just below ESC.
You can change your console key using the Setup Controls menu, or edit it in
the config.cfg file.
To exit the console, either press the console key again, or press
<b>ESC</b> which will close the console, and bring up the menu.
</p>

<p>The console displays all messages from the game. You can go back in
the messages with key <b>PAGE UP</b>, and go down with the key <b>PAGE
DOWN</b>. Press the key <b>HOME</b> to jump to the oldest message in the
console text buffer,
and key <b>END</b> to jump to the last output message (the most recent).
</p>

<p>When the console is off, the last lines of the console text buffer are
displayed at the top of the screen.
There you can see 5 lines of messages (the original Doom only showed 1 line).
You can change the message display duration with the console variable
<a href="#con_hudtime">con_hudtime</a>.
See the commands section for more information.
</p>


<h3 id="input">Console input</h3>

<p>While the console is on, you can type in commands.
<b>BACKSPACE</b> erases the last input character, and <b>ENTER</b> executes the command.
For convenience, you have a history of the last 32 commands entered.
Press <b>UP ARROW</b> to go back in the commands history, <b>DOWN ARROW</b> to
go forward.
</p>

<p>
Another useful key is <b>TAB</b>: it completes a partially
entered command or variable name.
This is also a good way to sequence through the existing commands,
without having to remember their exact spelling.
Enter the first letter, then press <b>TAB</b> to complete the command.
Each press of <b>TAB</b> displays another alternative command.
</p>

<p>Use <b>SHIFT-TAB</b> to step through the alternatives in reverse order.
It also completes the command line, when used after typing.
</p>

<div class="example">
The variables to customize the console itself usually start
with "con_". To see them all type "con" and press the <b>TAB</b> key.
The first con_ variable will be displayed, con_height.  Each press of
the <b>TAB</b> key will display the next variable, 
con_speed, con_hudtime, con_backpic...
</div>



<h3 id="cmd_var">Commands and variables</h3>

<p>The console accepts commands, and the setting and display of variables.
A <b>command</b> executes an operation.  It may have parameters.
A <b>variable</b> always has an associated value.
For example the variable <span class="keyword">name</span> holds your name as a player.
</p>

<p>Entering a command without any parameters will usually display the command syntax.
</p>

<div class="code">> map
Usage: map &lt;number|name&gt; [&lt;entrypoint&gt;]: warp players to a map.
</div>

<p>Entering a variable name without a value will display the current
value of the variable.
</p>

<div class="code">> name
"name" is "flynn"
</div>

<p>
To set the value of a variable, enter the variable name followed by the new value.
For example, to change your name to "dj fab", type
</p>

<div class="code">> name "dj fab"
flynn renamed to dj fab
</div>

<p>
  There are four types of variable and command parameters: <b>strings</b>,
  <b>integers</b>, <b>floats</b> (actually 16.16 fixed point numbers)
  and <b>booleans (true/false)</b>.
</p>
<p>
String values can be simple, such as Fred, or quoted, such as "Mr. Fred",
String values that contain spaces, or certain other special characters,
must be <b>quoted</b> using double quotes, as we saw in the previous example.
Inside a quoted string you can use the following C-style <b>backslash escape sequences</b>:
</p>
<table class="def">
  <tr><th>Escape sequence</th><th>Resulting character</th></tr>
  <tr><td>\\</td><td>literal backslash</td></tr>
  <tr><td>\"</td><td>double quote (does not end the string!)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>\t</td><td>tab</td></tr>
  <tr><td>\n</td><td>newline</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Example:</p>
<div class="code">> echo "this string contains \"escaped\" special chars such as \\,\n\ttab and newline"
this string contains "escaped" special chars such as \,
    tab and newline
</div>

<p>
Boolean variables (true/false, yes/no) use 0 to denote false.
Any nonzero value means true.
</p>

<p>
Integer variables are simple integer values, such as 2, and 13.
</p>

<p>
The float values are decimal values with a decimal point, such as 13.2, and 0.5.
</p>


<h3 id="config">Configuration files</h3>

<p>Most variables are automatically saved to the default configuration
file <b>config.cfg</b>. Like in the original Doom, the <a href="legacy.html#config">-config</a>
parameter will set explicitly the configuration file to use.
Thus, you can have default settings for different persons, using
different configuration files.
While the configuration files support any commands, and are executed
like a script, you should not edit them, because they are always overwritten
when the game exits.
</p>

<p>Some variables, like gravity, are not saved.  They are restored to
initial settings everytime DoomLegacy is started.  These might be
changed for a specific game, but would not want to be saved, as that
would affect all games that follow.  See Autoexec.cfg and exec files for
setting up DoomLegacy for a specific game.
</p>


<h3 id="autoexec">Autoexec.cfg</h3>

<p>The <b>autoexec.cfg</b> file is a text 'script' file which, if
found, is automatically executed at the game startup.
You can edit autoexec.cfg to set the values of those variables
that are not automatically saved to config.cfg. You can also add
commands that will be executed one after another, just like a script.
</p>

<p>Comments start with <b>//</b>.
Each line of the autoexec.cfg file is like a line that you would have
typed at the console. Here are some examples:
</p>

<p>This sample 'autoexec.cfg' will warp you to map01 as soon as the
game is loaded:
</p>

<div class="example">
// always start with map01, without waiting at the menu<br/>
map map01<br/>
echo "welcome to map 01"   //useless comment
</div>

<p>Another example, here we set the variables that are not saved to the
config.cfg, because they are not considered standard parameters:
</p>

<div class="example">
// set my preferred weird game mode<br/>
bloodtime 5   // blood lasts 5 seconds<br/>
fastmonsters 1<br/>
teamdamage 1<br/>
echo "bigjim's weird mode active"
</div>

<p>In the last example, each time you start the game, it will set the
variables like <a href="#bloodtime">bloodtime</a> that are not
normally saved to config.cfg.
Just look at config.cfg to find out which variables are saved.
</p>


<h3 id="scripts">Script files</h3>

<p>config.cfg and autoexec.cfg are script files. It means they
contain commands and variables that are executed in sequence.
You can create any number of script files, and execute them from the console
using the <a href="#exec">exec</a> command.
</p>

<p>For example, to start a script named blood.cfg just enter</p>

<div class="example">
&gt; exec blood.cfg
</div>



<hr/>
<h2 id="reference">Console commands and variables</h2>

<p>This chapter describes all the console commands and variables in Doom
Legacy.
Many console variables can also be modified through the menu.
You will need to use the console only if you want to customise the
game more to your needs.
</p>


<h3 id="basic_cmd">Basic commands</h3>

<p>Here are the basic commands for script execution. They have the same
usage and functionality as in Quake.
You can use a <b>semicolon</b> to separate several commands in the same line.
</p>

<table class="def">
<tr><th>command</th><th>definition</th></tr>

<tr><td>alias &lt;aliasname&gt; &lt;command&gt;</td>
<td>
<p>
Define an alias.
When you type &lt;aliasname&gt;, it will be like if you had
entered &lt;command&gt;. Let's have an example:
</p>
<div class="example">
&gt; alias silence "soundvolume 0; musicvolume 0"
</div>
<p>
When you will type "silence", it will execute the
corresponding command. In this example, we have given two
commands as one, inside " ", and using the semicolon as a separator
for commands.
</p>
</td></tr>

<tr><td>echo &lt;text&gt;</td>
<td>Just echoes (prints) the text to console.</td></tr>

<tr><td id="exec">exec &lt;filename&gt;</td>
<td>
<p>
Execute a script file. A script file is just a text file
containing a sequence of commands or variables. Script files
usually have the .cfg extension.
Example:
</p>
<div class="example">
&gt; exec autoexec.cfg
</div>
<p>
will execute all the commands in autoexec.cfg
</p>
</td></tr>

<tr><td>help [&lt;variable&gt;]</td>
<td>
Shows a list of all the console commands and variables.<br/>
If given a variable name, shows detailed info on that variable.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>toggle &lt;variable&gt; [&lt;value&gt;]</td>
<td>
<p>
Without the &lt;value&gt; parameter this toggles a variable,
i.e. changes it to the next possible value.
With the &lt;value&gt; parameter it adds &lt;value&gt; to the variable.
This command is very useful for use with <a href="#bind">bind</a>. Example:
</p>
<div class="example">
bind "&gt;" "toggle gr_fogdensity"<br/>
bind "&lt;" "toggle gr_fogdensity -1"
</div>
<p>
so you can modify fogdensity without going into the console or menu!
</p>
</td></tr>

<tr><td>wait [&lt;ticks&gt;]</td>
<td>
<p>
Wait a given amount of time before the next command is executed.
The unit is 1/35 seconds. Example: this will wait 5 seconds, then
display "ok!".
</p>
<div class="example">
wait 175; echo "ok!"
</div>
</td></tr>

<tr><td id="bind">bind &lt;keyname&gt; &lt;command&gt;</td>
<td>
<p>
Bind commands to a key. Each time you press the key,
the commands will be executed. Example:
</p>
<div class="example">
&gt; bind s screenshot
</div>
<p>
Now each time you press the s key the game will save a screenshot.
</p>
</td></tr>

<tr><td>cls</td>
<td>Clear the console text buffer.</td></tr>
</table>


<h3 id="con_setup">Console setup</h3>

<p>These variables control the look and feel of the console.
</p>

<table class="def">
<tr><th>variable</th><th>type</th><th>definition</th></tr>

<tr><td>con_backpic</td><td>bool</td>
<td>
0: use a translucent LCD-like console background.<br/>
1: use an opaque
<a href="editing.html#CONSBACK">console background picture</a>, like in Quake.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>con_height</td><td>int</td>
<td>
How many percent of the total screen height the console
will use. E.g. con_height 50 (the default) will use half the
screen height for the console.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>con_speed</td><td>int</td>
<td>
The speed (in pixels/tic) at which the console comes down or moves out of
the screen when you press the console toggle key.
</td></tr>

<tr><td id="con_hudtime">con_hudtime</td><td>int</td>
<td>
The number of seconds messages stay on the top
of the screen. They are 5 message lines that scroll as soon
as new messages arrive. E.g. con_hudtime 5, which is the
default, will make the messages stay for 5 seconds before
disappearing. Set this to 0, and you will never see any
messages outside the console (HUD means heads-up display).
</td></tr>

<tr><td>showmessages<br>&lt;0-5&gt;</td><td>int</td>
<td>
Limits the messages that are shown on the HUD during gameplay.
<ul>
<li>Off: never show any messages on the screen.</li>
<li>Minimal: Important play messages are shown, like you got the BFG.
Common messages, like those about ammo, are not shown.</li>
<li>Play: The standard Play messages are shown, but verbose and diagnostic
messages are not (default).</li>
<li>Verbose: Verbose messages too.</li>
<li>Debug:  Debug and Verbose messages too.</li>
<li>Dev: Development.  All messages are shown.</li>
</ul>
There is also a control for this in the Options menu.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>darkback<br>&lt;0-2&gt;</td><td>int</td>
<td>
The console background is darkened to make the text easier to read.
This controls how dark it gets.<ul>
<li>Half: Half darkness (40%).</li>
<li>Med: Middle darkness (25%).</li>
<li>Dark: Darkest (17%).</li>
</ul>
 There is also a control for this in the Video menu.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>con_fontsize &lt;1-5&gt;</td><td>int</td>
<td>
The console fontsize.
<ul>
<li>Small: Smallest font.</li>
<li>Med2:</li>
<li>Med3:</li>
<li>Med4:</li>
<li>Large: Largest font.</li>
</ul>
There is also a control for this in the Video menu.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>msg_fontsize &lt;1-5&gt;</td><td>int</td>
<td>
The HUD message fontsize. 
<ul>
<li>Small: Smallest font.</li>
<li>Med2:</li>
<li>Med3:</li>
<li>Med4:</li>
<li>Large: Largest font.</li>
</ul>
There is also a control for this in the Video menu.
</td></tr>
</table>



<h3 id="player_setup">Player setup</h3>

<p>These variables control your player avatar's appearance and your game
preferences. The splitscreenplayer has similar variables, but with the
number 2 appended to the variable name, e.g. "color2 red" turns the
splitscreenplayer's avatar red.
</p>

<table class="def">
<tr><th>variable</th><th>type</th><th>definition</th></tr>

<tr><td>splitscreen</td><td>bool</td>
<td>
Enable/disable the splitscreen. If necessary, this spawns a secondary
local player, called the splitscreenplayer.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>name</td><td>string</td>
<td>
Enter your name as a player, for network games. Your name will
be seen when you send a message (chat key), and is displayed
in the deathmatch rankings. Use "" if the name contains spaces,
e.g. <span class="example">name "dj fabbe"</span>
</td></tr>

<tr><td>color<br>&lt;0 - 10&gt;</td><td>int</td>
<td>
Choose your avatar's color.
<ul>
<li> 0: Green</li>
<li> 1: Gray</li>
<li> 2: Brown</li>
<li> 3: Red</li>
<li> 4: Light Gray</li>
<li> 5: Light Brown</li>
<li> 6: Light Red</li>
<li> 7: Light Blue</li>
<li> 8: Blue</li>
<li> 9: Yellow</li>
<li>10: Beige</li>
</ul>
</td></tr>

<tr><td>skin</td><td>string</td>
<td>
Change your skin, provided some skins are loaded (use
the commandline option <a href="legacy.html#file">-file</a>
to add skins wads. The default marine skin
name is "marine".
</td></tr>

<tr><td>autoaim</td><td>bool</td>
<td>
The original Doom used autoaiming in the vertical direction, and a
small aim adjustment in the horizontal.
Now that you can freely aim up and down with the freelook, you can
play like a pro and set autoaim off.<br/>

NETWORK NOTE: in a multiplayer game, the server can force
the autoaim off for all players with the command
<a href="#allowautoaim">allowautoaim</a>.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>originalweaponswitch</td><td>bool</td>
<td>
Choose whether to use the original weapon change method (1), or
the new preferred weapons order (0), see
<a href="#weaponpref">weaponpref</a> for more.<br/>

With the original weapon switch, whenever you pick up a new weapon
it becomes the active one, even if it is not as powerful
as the one you are currently using. That can be sometimes very
annoying, especially in fast deathmatches.
</td></tr>


<tr><td id="weaponpref">weaponpref</td><td>string</td>
<td>
The preferred weapons order.<br/>
This works only if you have set originalweaponswitch to 0.

<p>You give a priority to each of the weapons, with a number digit
from 0 to 9. Several weapons can have the same priority.
When you pick up a weapon that you don't already have, you
will switch to that weapon IF AND ONLY IF that weapon's priority
is greater that the one you are carrying. If you already had the
weapon, you will pickup the ammo as usual, without changing
weapon.
The command is given a string of priority values, one for each weapon, in the following order:
</p>

<p>Fist, Chainsaw, Pistol, Shotgun, Super Shotgun, Chaingun, Rocket
  Launcher, Plasma Rifle, BFG.
</p>

<p>Thus 'weaponpref "021485763"' means that the super shotgun has
the highest priority (8), while the fist is lowest priority (0).
After the super shotgun, in decreasing priority you have the
rocket launcher (7), plasma gun (6), chaingun (5), shotgun (4),
BFG (3), chainsaw (2) and pistol (1).
</p>

<p>Let's have another interesting example: 'weaponpref "333333333"'
</p>

<p>Since all weapons have the same priority in this last example,
you will NEVER change weapon automatically, because
no weapon has a priority higher than any other one. You might
consider this the manual weapon change.
</p>
</td></tr>

<tr><td>crosshair<br>&lt;0 - 3&gt;</td><td>int</td>
<td>
Choose the type of aiming point (crosshair) that appears on the screen.
<ul>
<li>Off:  No crosshair</li>
<li>Cross: Large white + with an open center, the largest crosshair.
<li>Angle: Small vertical and horizontal green lines.  The aiming point is where the two lines meet.
<li>Point: Red aiming dot, like a laser pointer.
</td></tr>
There is a control in the Options menu.
</table>



<h3 id="player_controls">Player controls</h3>

<p>These variables control the way the game handles the players' input.
The splitscreenplayer has similar variables, but with the
number 2 appended to the variable name.
</p>

<table class="def">
<tr><th>variable</th><th>type</th><th>definition</th></tr>

<tr><td>autorun</td><td>bool</td>
<td>
Set this to 1 to invert the <b>run</b> key. You will always be running,
EXCEPT when you push the run key.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>automlook</td><td>bool</td>
<td>
<p>You can use the "freelook" (ability to look up and down) in two
modes: permanent or temporary.
</p>

<p>Setting this variable to 1 will make the freelook permanent.
</p>

<p>When automlook is 0, you will need to hold the freelook
key down while moving the mouse up and down. When releasing the key,
the view will always re-center. This is useful if you keep
firing rockets at your feet.
</p>
</td></tr>


<tr><td>use_mouse</td><td>bool</td>
<td>
Setting use_mouse to 0 will disable the mouse. The next time
you start the game, the mouse won't be detected.

Set use_mouse to 1 to search for a mouse, and activate it.
There is also a control for this in the Mouse menu.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>invertmouse</td><td>bool</td>
<td>
Set invertmouse to 1 to invert the mouse y (up and down) axis.
This is for freelook only, you will look up, when moving the mouse
down (backward), and look down when moving mouse forward.
There is also a control for this in the Mouse menu.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>mousemove</td><td>bool</td>
<td>
Enable/disable mouse y-axis for forward/backward movement.
There is also a control for this in the Mouse menu.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>mousesensx<br/>
mousesensy</td><td>int</td>
<td>
Sets the mouse sensitivity in the x and y directions.
There is also a control for this in the Mouse menu.
</td></tr>
</table>


<p>These input variables are common to both local players.
</p>

<table class="def">
<tr><th>variable</th><th>type</th><th>definition</th></tr>

<tr><td>controlperkey &lt;1|2&gt;</td><td>int</td>
<td>
When set to 2 (several) you can bind more than one control to a key.
Otherwise binding a control to a key will remove the key's other
assignations.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>mouse2port &lt;1|2|3|4&gt;</td><td>int</td>
<td>
Choose the port number of the secondary mouse for the
splitscreenplayer between COM1 to COM4.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>mousemotion</td><td>enum</td>
<td>
Values Absolute | Relative.
SDL port only.<br>
Absolute: Uses the original mouse interface with local difference
calculations.
It should work for any SDL port.<br>
Relative: Uses the newer relative motion interface, which
may not work on some SDL library ports.  It is reported to work with
Linux and Windows.
Does not affect mouse2.
There is also a control for this in the Mouse menu.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>grabinput</td><td>bool</td>
<td>
Sets the SDL grabinput attribute.  This keeps the mouse in the window.
It also disables most of any window manager's keyboard and mouse functions,
so DoomLegacy gets all combination events.
Pause releases grabinput to let the mouse be used outside of DoomLegacy.
There is also a control for this in the Mouse menu.
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
The game controls can be defined using the setcontrol command.
</p>

<table class="def">
<tr><th>command</th><th>definition</th></tr>

<tr><td>setcontrol &lt;control&gt; &lt;key1&gt; [&lt;key2&gt;]</td>
<td>
<p>Binds a key/joystick button/mouse button to a
game control (<span class="keyword">forward</span>, <span class="keyword">fire</span>, <span class="keyword">use</span> etc.).
The second keyname is optional. You can set it, and have
two keys attached to one game control, e.g. have both <b>UP ARROW</b>
and <b>MOUSE2</b> mean <span class="keyword">forward</span>.
</p>

<p>If a key does not have a useful name, it uses a name of the
form 'KEYxxx' where xxx is the key code.
To learn the names of the keys, look for them at the Setup Controls menu.
</p>

<p>The controls are <span class="keyword">forward, backward, strafe, 
straferight, strafeleft, speed, turnleft, turnright, 
fire, use, lookup, lookdown, centerview, mouseaiming, 
weapon1, weapon2, ..., weapon8, talkkey, scores,

<tr><td>voodoo_mode</td><td>string</td>
<td>
Sets the voodoo doll behavior.  A voodoo doll is an accident of the
original doom code that occurs when a wad has extra player starts.
The voodoo dolls that are spawned at the extra starts look like
players, but do not move on their own. When they get shot or
damaged, a player gets damaged too.  Many wads use voodoo dolls for
automated actions because they can trip linedefs.
<ul>
  <li>Vanilla: No enhancements. Allows zombies and walking dead players.</li>
  <li>Multispawn: The target of damage is determined by the wad spawn type.</li>
  <li>Target: DoomLegacy will attempt to determine the player that
    triggered the voodoo doll, and will put the damage on them.  There are
    still many ways the wrong player can get hurt (which is wad related),
    some as simple as one player tripping the death-trap, right before
    another pushes the switch to turn it off
    (if timed right, the player at the switch dies instead).</li>
  <li>Auto: If the wad has multiple player voodoo spawning, then it
    switches to Multispawn, otherwise it will be Target.</li>
</ul>
Default is Auto.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>instadeath</td><td>string</td>

Used to mitigate the effects of voodoo doll teleport frag.
For coop and deathmatch play, a setting other than Die is suggested.

The telefrag kills the player instantly, thus the name "instadeath".
Used in unusual wad traps to kill the player, like when
they touch something dangerous.
Vanilla voodoo doll behavior has the voodoo doll instadeath always killing
the same player, and it does not matter who walked into the death-trap.
In most wads the victim is always player1.
<ul>
  <li>Die: Telefrag death of player.</li>
  <li>Damage: Player takes 20 damage, stunned, and gets thrown back.</li>
  <li>Zap: Player takes 5 damage, stunned longer, and gets thrown back.</li>

<tr><td>zerotag</td><td>int</td>
<td>
Control if sectors with a tag value of 0 will react to a linedef with a tag
of 0.
By default, new sectors have a tag value of 0.

with the default value, causing havoc.
<ul>
  <li>Allow: Allow tag values of 0, just like vanilla Doom.</li>
  <li>Boom: Ignore most linedefs that have a tag value of 0.
      It is valid special case for only a few linedefs.</li>
</ul>
Default is Boom.

gr_mlook command is there for fixing the "mlook" bug (when you look

The "Off" (0) should only use if you don't use full mlook.
The "On" (1) is fast and fix most of the mlook bug, but walls
behind you can be hidden if you look at nearly 90° (up or down).
It shouldn't be a big issue for most of you and it's the
recommended mode for low end pc.
The "Full" (2) is exactly the same as "On" but it fix all the
bugs and is a little slower for angle &gt; 45 degree.

The gr_mlook command has been "optimized" recently. That's why, when
you're aiming at an angle of 0, it acts like if gr_mlook was Off,
even if gr_mlook is set to On or Full, and thus it's faster. There
is something similar with angle less than 45: if you use gr_mlook
Full, it act like gr_mlook On.

gr_staticlighting

This is an experimental variable for now since it's not yet
optimized. I don't recommend you to use it, except if you have
the cream of the cream PC. It's ok for some maps, though.

Prints out the memory usage of the hardware renderer.

gr_solvetjoin
</td><td>bool</td>

Experimental control to disable the Solve T-join problem code.  The function
tries to combine vertexes that are close together. 
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
gr_polyshape
</td><td>int</td>
<td>
Controls the polygon generation, and what shape is allowed.
The least amount of overdraw usually gives the fastest rendering.
<ul>
<li>Subsector : Disables cutting the subsector polygon.
The polygon is the shape of the BSP subsector.
Has the most overdraw into void areas.
</li>
<li>Fat : Trims void space from the subsector polygon with segs that
cross the entire subsector.  Ignores short segs.
The floor and ceiling overdraw into void areas.
</li>
<li>Trim : Trims the subsector polygons with the segs.
Combines short segs to find cuts across the entire subsector.
When a polygon becomes non-convex, then selected vertexes are removed until
it is convex.
Usually generates smaller polygons than Fat, but there is still some
overdraw into void areas where the polygon is forced to be convex.
</li>
<li>NotConvex : Generates polygons with the least overdraw, but some
may be non-convex due to the shape and segs of the subsector.
The polygons are required to be convex for hardware draw,
but some libraries may tolerate drawing non-convex polygons.
My nVidia supplied OpenGL library apparantly does.
Test at your own risk, but I do not recommend using it.
</li>
</ul>
The default is Trim.

<tr><td>
gr_polytile
</td><td>bool</td>
<td>
Enables the polytile code that shares vertexes between poly so as to
prevent cracks between polys from forming.  This control allows the user to disable this code easily.
Default is enabled.

  Loading the CDROM is slow.  You need to wait until the CDROM is done
  loading the CDROM before you can even get info on it.  If you have
  multiple CDROM, DoomLegacy will try to use the first.  Under Linux
  this is /dev/cdrom.
<p>
  SDL cannot control the CDROM music volume.  Under SDL the CDROM music
  volume control has been reduced to an on/off switch, which does PAUSE.
  SDL 1.2.15 is the end of CDROM support in SDL.  SDL 2.x will not
  support CDROM music.
<p>
  Playing the CDROM music with loop (repeat the song) requires DoomLegacy
  to check that the music has stopped.  With Linux, and probably some other
  systems too, this CDROM hardware check blocks execution for about 1/4 second.
  With previous DoomLegacy versions, this check occurred every 2 seconds.
  DoomLegacy 1.46.3 checks every 4 seconds, near the expected end of
  the music, and only when it is set to loop the music.
<p>
  This CDROM check can be avoided entirely by not using using cd play loop.
  Using CDROM music play loop in a netgame may get you kicked due to
  consistency failure, due to the CDROM check blocking play.
  When loading a new level map, if cd is enabled it will start play loop
  of the track for that map.  Playing a CD using a separate program
  on your computer may work better, especially during net play.
<p>
  Normally, the game plays track xx during map MAPxx.
  With Doom ExMy levels, the track number is 9*x+y.
  The remap command is useful to choose which cd music is played for each
  level map.  All the level maps must be listed sequentially in the remap
  command, it always starts from map01.
  Let's have an example:<br/>
  <br/>
  cd remap 5 3 1 4 2<br/>
  <br/>
  At map 1, the game will play track 5 etc. The same track number can
  be also be repeated.
