<h2><a name="errors">Setup</a></h2>

<dl>
  <dt>
What command line switches should I use to start DoomLegacy?
  </dt>
  <dd>
See the docs/legacy.html for an explanation of the switches.
<p>
If you have a console, start DoomLegacy with the -h switch to see the
help output.
<p>If you do not want the Launcher to start, then have at least one
switch on the command line.
It does not have to be a real switch, -nolaunch, or even -xx will do it.
<p>If you do not have a command line console, or do not want to use it,
you can start DoomLegacy without any switches, which will bring up the
Doom Legacy built-in Launcher.
From the Launcher you can specify almost all switches.
The switches -mb (Zalloc memory size), -h (help) are handled before the built-in Launcher runs,
and thus the Launcher will ignore them.
<p>
For command line switches, I recommend using native video, and you must select your game.
<br>
> doomlegacy -native -game doom2
  </dd>
</dl>

From the Launcher this would be:
<pre>
  Switch:  -native
  Game:    doom2
  Continue
</pre>

<dl>
  <dt>
  How does DoomLegacy determine the HOME directory.
  </dt>
  <dd>
  <ul>
  <li>It is specified by the -home switch on the command line.</li>
  <li>
The HOME environment variable is specified.  Linux, BSD,
and unix-like operating systems setup HOME during user login.
  </li>
  <li>
The "UserProfile" environment variable is specified.  The is done
by WinXP, and probably later versions of Windows (but they change and break things too).
This will make the parent of "My Documents" your home directory by default.
  </li>
  <li>
The default directory specified by DEFHOME in the doomdef.h
file is found to exist.
  </li>  
  <li>
If none of these exist then DoomLegacy will make a home directory in
the program directory using the DEFHOME name.
  </li>  
  </ul>
If you are inconsistent about specifying the home directory, you
can easily have more than one set of config files.
  </dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>
DoomLegacy tries to use the MSYS home directory.
<br>DoomLegacy does not use the MSYS home directory anymore.
  </dt>
  <dd>
MSYS sets the HOME environment variable to its own home directory
for use by MSYS commands.
Older versions of DoomLegacy would use the MSYS home,
but DoomLegacy 1.46 ignores a HOME environment variable that has
the string MSYS in it.
If you had your home directory in MSYS,
then it would be best to move to a more reasonable home location.
You may have to specify it with the -home switch if it is an odd location.
<p>DoomLegacy 1.46 also recognizes the environment variable "UserProfile" as
home, which appears on WinXP (and probably later versions of Windows too).
This will make the parent of "My Documents" your home directory automatically.
  </dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>
Where does DoomLegacy put the savegames.
  </dt>
  <dd>
DoomLegacy puts savegames and the saved config file in a doomlegacy
directory within the home directory.
<br>The doomlegacy directory name is operating-system dependent.
It is compiled with two choices, defined as DEFAULTDIR1 and DEFAULTDIR2
in the doomdef.h file.
If neither of those directories is found, DoomLegacy will make a directory
using the name from DEFAULTDIR1.
The name defined by DEFAULTDIR2 is an older directory name,
used to find existing directories from older versions of DoomLegacy.
<ul>
<li>Linux:  ".doomlegacy", or previously ".legacy".
<br>This is a hidden directory. Use "ls -a" to see hidden directories,
or enable seeing hidden directories in your preferences.
</li>
<li>Windows: "doomlegacy", or previously "legacy".
<br>On WinXP and later, this may be hidden in the parent directory
above "My Documents".
</li>
<li>DOS: "dmlegacy", or previously "legacy".
</li>
  </dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>
DoomLegacy keeps losing my config settings.
  </dt>
  <dd>
<p>The config settings are saved by DoomLegacy during program shutdown.
If it is being killed some other way, the settings will not be saved.
<p>If you are inconsisent about specifying your home directory, then
DoomLegacy will create a new config file in each new location.
If you find you have to setup your keyboard again, then you may have
mistyped your -home directory name.  Setup a profile or a batch
file to start DoomLegacy from saved settings to ensure getting a consistent
home directory.
<p>OpenGL hardware rendering has its own separate config file.
You will have to set all your settings again, sorry.
  </dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>
When a friend comes over to play, he changes my keyboard settings.
Is there any way to save my settings?
  </dt>
  <dd>
Give your friend (George) their own config file.
<br>Start DoomLegacy with "-config george.cfg".
<p>George will now have his own config settings.  As long as you do not
delete the file, George's settings will still be there next time he comes
to visit.
<p>Give your friend their own home directory, with its own config file
and savegames.
<br>Make a directory named "george_home".
<br>Start DoomLegacy with "-home george_home".
<p>DoomLegacy will make a doomlegacy directory in the george_home
directory, where it will put config.cfg and savegames.  On Linux this
is a hidden directory, so the george_home directory will appear empty,
but it is not empty.
  <p>
  </dd>
</dl>


<h2><a name="errors">Errors</a></h2>

<dl>
  <dt>
I don't see any error messages from DoomLegacy, and I think there
should be some.  Where are the error messages going?
  </dt>
  <dd>
DoomLegacy now has an improved message control in the Options menu.
It allows you to block some messages from the HUD and console during gameplay.
If a problem occurs during gameplay, then turn the message control up to
debug to see the messages.
The message control only filters some of the messages from appearing
on the HUD or console.
The message routing will still send a copy of each message to other locations,
to stderr, and to the log file (if enabled).
<p>Starting DoomLegacy with the verbose switch (-v or -v2) will
enable generating more messages, and will provide more detail about what
DoomLegacy is doing.
The -v2 switch dumps much more detail than you usually want to see,
especially about video hardware.
<p>Pre-release versions of DoomLegacy usually have debugging print statements
(EMSG_debug) enabled full-time.
Compiling with DEBUG_MESSAGES_ON enabled in doomdef.h,
allows debug messages to be seen on the console and HUD at all times.
<p>With a release version of DoomLegacy, use verbose (-v or -v2)
to enable the same debug message displays.
The message option control also can enable seeing debug messages
during game play.
<p>
The development switch ( -devparm ) provides details meant for
developing the game and game wads.
<p>
On Windows, the error messages go to a file "stderr.txt" that is left
in the program directory.
  </dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>
I get the error "Error: W_GetNumForName: STBAR not found!"
What is it?
  </dt>
  <dd>
You have an old version of doom.wad. Just upgrade your version to 1.9.
You can find a patch on the id Software site.
  </dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>
When I play Heretic, there are all these error messages about missing textures.
  </dt>
  <dd>
The switch texture names for Doom and Heretic are hard coded into the program.
The heretic switches were simply incuded with all the Doom switches, and the warning messages previously output were about
the Doom switches that are not in the Heretic wad. 
<br>Since DoomLegacy 1.46, it has separate lists, and no longer puts out these warning messages.
  </dd>
</dl>


<h2><a name="misc">Compatibility</a></h2>

<dl>
  <dt>
The player acts weird in the Doom wad demos.
Is there a setting to make the demos work right?
  </dt>
  <dd>
No, Demo compatibility is automated.
<p>
DoomLegacy does not maintain sync with the Doom demos.  It was decided some
years back, that demo compatibility would be sacrificed in favor of
new features and improvements.
<p>The demos only record the player actions and movements.
Every monster and object reaction is the result of applying random numbers
and player input.
<p>To playback a demo, the engine must generate the exact same sequence of
random numbers, and apply them to get the exact same situation that developed
during the recording.  The monsters must react and walk the exact same
paths as when the demo was recorded.  Almost every calculation of the
DoomLegacy engine must come out identical to the recording Doom engine.
The slightest difference in using a random number, or in
calculating a monster, player, or projectile position, has cumulative
effects in the playback.
With the slightest position error, it rapidly gets to the point where the
playback of player movements is completely irrelevant to the current situation.
<p>Some attempts have been made fix this with compatibility enables in
the code, to revert the engine to generate compatible output
This puts the bugs back in the code.
The current demo compatibility code mostly covers Doom demo and Boom
demo formats, but not others.  It has improved old demo playback, somewhat.
<p>DoomLegacy has its own variation on the demo format.  Like Boom,
it needs to record a whole bunch of optional settings, all which
affect demo playback.
<p>DoomLegacy 1.46, will playback demos recorded with DoomLegacy, and
remain in sync.
I will not make any guarantees on this for long demos, or every situation,
as it has not been tested much.
<p>Doomlegacy 1.47, has included some old code that is run for some
old demos. This makes some of the old Doom demos stay in sync for
much longer now.
  </dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>
The game does not look the same as other versions of Doom.
  </dt>
  <dd>
Doom Legacy is an advanced port with many new features.  These features
offer improved and alternative behaviors over previous versions and other ports.
The controls to select your preferred behavior for these features are
in the <b>options menu</b>.  Your settings will be saved to your config
file when you exit the game.  These features can also be controlled
by setting variables using the console.
<p>However, if you're looking for the 100% authentic 1990s Doom experience, you
could try <a href="http://www.chocolate-doom.org/wiki/index.php/Chocolate_Doom">Chocolate Doom</a>.
  </dd>
</dl>


<dl>
  <dt>
I want to add switches to Heretic and Blasphemer wads.
The SWITCHES lump works for Doom, but it does not work with Heretic.
  </dt>
  <dd>
<p>This was fixed in DoomLegacy 1.46, which has separate Doom and Heretic
internal switch tables.
<p>
Historical Info:
Doom and Heretic would only load the switches for that version and lower,
as identified by an episode number in the switch tables.
The code as Shareware Doom episode = 1, Ultimate Doom episode = 2, Doom II episode = 3.
Heretic has a similar scheme with Shareware episode = 1,
and Heretic episode = 2, but it only contained two switches both with episode = 1.
<p>The Boom SWITCHES lump is loaded for both Doom and Heretic game modes.
The usage problem with Heretic was that in previous DoomLegacy the Heretic
switch names were distinguished by having an episode = 4 in the entry,
which required the SWITCHES lump to also have episode = 4.
Such a SWITCHES lump would not have worked with other ports.
<p>
Since DoomLegacy 1.46, we no longer use that scheme.
For compatibility, a Heretic SWITCHES lump should have episode = 1,
or even episode = 2,
but DoomLegacy will still accept switches lump entries with episode = 4 for Heretic.

<h2><a name="input">Mouse/Joystick/Keyboard</a></h2>

<dl>
  <dt>My mouse/joystick does not work.</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
First, check that the mouse/joystick is activated : go at the
console and type either 'use_mouse' (or use the respective
menuitem) or 'use_joystick'.
If it is '0' or off then that mouse/joystick is disabled.
Set the variable to 1. eg: 'use_mouse 1'.
    </p>
    <p>
Once the mouse or joystick is activated, you have to
bind the buttons to controls in the <b>setup controls menu</b>.
    </p>
 </dd>
</dl>


<h2><a name="video">Video</a></h2>

<dl>
  <dt>The game doesn't restore the video mode I have chosen the last time
I played Doom Legacy.
  </dt>
  <dd>
The current video mode has to be made the 'default' so that it is
saved to the config file.  Press the key 'd' on the Video Options menu
to set the current video mode as the default.
<p>Otherwise, the video mode you select is only temporary for this run
of DoomLegacy.  This supports testing modes before committing to using them.
If you select some video mode that will not display
properly and you have to abort, or even reboot, it does not become
stuck to DoomLegacy.  The next time DoomLegacy is started it will
revert to the known good video mode saved in the config file.
<p>Do not set a video mode to default until you know it is good.
If you have a bad video mode and cannot see the video controls in the DoomLegacy menu,
you will have to edit the config file by hand,
or delete your config file to clear the bad video mode.
The config file is re-written when DoomLegacy exits, so do not leave
the config file open in your editor while running DoomLegacy.
  </dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>The game display is sideways.</dt>
  <dd>
Some monitors can be tilted to be tall, for working with documents.
They have display modes like 800x600, and 600x800.
They can detect 600x800 (where the 800 is the height), assume the
tilted mode, and display the raster accordingly.  Other tilt monitors
may sense the tilted mode with a switch instead.
Use the 800x600 video mode instead.
  </dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>The game display proportions are wrong.</dt>
  <dd>
  <p>
The original Doom graphics were designed for a 320x200 VGA display with
a 4:3 physical aspect ratio. Consequently the pixels on these displays
had a 5:6 physical aspect ratio, unlike most modern displays which have
square pixels. This makes rendering the graphics on modern displays
somewhat complicated.
  </p>
  <p>
The menus and intermission screens are scaled at integer ratios to
fit the screen.  This will often leave bars at the edges.  Because
these are drawn using color palette graphics from the wad, attempts
at finer interpolation required looking up blended colors in a palette,
which leads to a muddy look.  To avoid this problem, the menus will be
scaled larger or smaller for some video display modes.
  </p>
  <p>
The game rendering is fully scaled to display the same view at
all video display modes.
  </p>
  <p>
In software render mode, Doom Legacy will proportion the display to keep
the original display appearance.  It will display with filler bars if
necessary to do this.  The pixels will not be identical
to those from the original Doom.
  </p>
  <p>
In OpenGL mode using fullscreen, the introduction and intermission pictures
are stretched to fill the screen.  This does not keep the original aspect ratio.
The game rendering is adjusted to approximate the 320x200 screen
size, and the field of view of the original software renderer, assuming the
display is 4:3.
There is a FOV control, but it zooms and does not change the aspect ratio.
  </p>
  <p>
When you have a 16:9 display, Doom Legacy displays expecting a 4:3
aspect, and the monitor may stretch it to fill the 16:9 shape.
This will alter the appearance of rooms and sprites.
Most monitors can be set to display a 4:3 aspect with black borders.
One alternative is to turn off fullscreen, and choose a window size
that fills most of the screen.
  </p>
  </dd>
</dl>


<dl>
  <dt>I cannot use some of the large fullscreen video modes of my monitor.
  </dt>
  <dd>
There are many large format monitors that exceed the internal display
limits in DoomLegacy.
<p>There are limits to the monitor width because every texture segment
saves display state in a structure of that maximum line width.
To expand the line width limit for a few, we would have to do it for every
user regardless of their hardware.
<p>Eventually, this will have to be changed to allow using larger monitors
in fullscreen.  That will require a rewrite of most of the texture segment
code to some other, slower, texture segment state storage scheme.
  </dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>I cannot use the 16:9 format of my monitor.
  </dt>
  <dd>
DoomLegacy only considers the standard proportion monitor modes.
There are more than a few problems to be solved before wider monitor
modes will be allowed.
<p>Is that cheating for one player to have such a wide view?
It is more fair in deathmatch for all players to have the
same field of view.  There will have to be network controls to allow using
wide field of view.
<p>This will also have to be changed soon (been saying that for years),
as wide screen monitors are now commonplace.
  </dd>
</dl>


<h2><a name="audio">Audio</a></h2>

<dl>
  <dt>
The music volume control is not independent of the sound effects
volume control.
  </dt>
  <dd>
More recent Windows products changed the sound interface to implement
only one volume control for a program.  All the Doom ports have had
problems with this.  Doom Legacy has not implemented any of
the suggested solutions yet.  One requires starting an independent task to
play the music, just to get the independent volume control.
  </dd>
</dl>


<h2><a name="network">Network</a></h2>

<dl>
  <dt>Where can I find Internet servers?</dt>
  <dd>
    Try <a href="http://doomconnector.co.nr/">Doom Connector</a>.
<p>The last I heard, there was still a DoomLegacy server up, but it was
running an older DoomLegacy.
<p>The Game server locations respond to requests.
The interested parties should submit a request to the Game Server to host a
DoomLegacy 1.47 Server.
  </dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>We have a fast computer, can we use it as an DoomLegacy Internet server?</dt>
  <dd>
You only need the IP address of your fast computer, and that IP
addresses must be communicated to the other players
(probably by cell-phone or email).
<p>A static IP address only has to be setup once in the
DoomLegacy Server menu of each player.
<p>If it is a dynamic IP address, then each player must setup the server IP
address every time the server connects to the Internet, because that
IP address will likely be different each time.
<p>Your success at this may depend upon filtering done by your IP
service providers.  It will not work if they are blocking packets using the
DoomLegacy port address (port 5029).
<p>Your firewall also has to let through the DoomLegacy port address
(port 5029).
  </dd>
</dl>


<dl>
  <dt>What IP address should we use for a local network?</dt>
  <dd>
The IP addresses in the range 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.254.254 are
reserved for local network usage.
<p>Your local network will be limited to an address range, a subnet.
If your netmask is the usual 255.255.255.0, then your subnet is limited to
only vary the last number, and all the computers on that subnet must
have the same first three numbers.
<p>Pick an IP address for your server, such as 192.168.3.2.  All your
player computers then need to have unique IP addresses on the subnet 192.168.3.xx,
where xx is 2..254.
<p>
For this example, lets consider the network 192.168.3.0,
which has a computer 192.168.3.2,
and two visitors at 192.1.3.72, and 192.1.3.246.
<p>
If you have a router with DHCP, such as your wifi-router,
then it will automatically assign an IP address in your subnet when the
visitor computer connects to the wifi.
Without DHCP, you have static IP addresses, and the visitors will have to modify
their IP address to work on your network.
<p>If your DoomLegacy server is connected using DHCP, then the server IP address
may be different then last time you played.  You will then have to config every
client computer to use the new server IP address, which is bothersome.
Most modern routers will connect a recognized computer to the same IP address it
used last time it was connected.
You can set up your router to do this, or even assign a static IP address to the server.
Otherwise, make sure the server connects to the network first, so some
client does not steal the preferred IP address it uses.
<p>It does not matter what IP address the clients get, as long as it
is an address on your subnet.
The server gets the client IP address from their first connect message.
<p>Without DHCP, modern internet communications should allow you to
add the server IP address
to your recognized addresses (static or manual routing) for a particular hardware device
(like your wifi-router, or Ethernet router, assuming you have the firewall enabled).
Just add the needed addresses, you should not have to replace any existing internet address.
<p>Your firewall has to let through the DoomLegacy server port address
(port 5029).
<p>If any of your clients are using an unusual port address, then your
firewall will also need to let through messages to that port.
  </dd>
</dl>


<dl>
  <dt>My ISP does not like Port 5029, can we change it?</dt>
  <dt>There is another Doom at 5029, can we use a different port?</dt>
  <dd>
The server port can be specified using a command line switch "-udpport 5029".
You must avoid any existing port your ISP may be using for services.
<p>The user reserved ports start at 5000.  I recommend only going up from
5029, such as 5100 .. 5199, to avoid other programs.
<p>All your players (clients) must specify the same port number on their command
line, and fix their firewalls to allow through packets that use that port.
  </dd>
</dl>


<dl>
  <dt>DoomLegacy will not play with older DoomLegacy servers?
  </dt>
  <dd>
The Network version has been bumped to Version 24 in DoomLegacy 1.47.
Some of the network messages have been changed.
Since DoomLegacy 1.46, the network code has been hardened against
malicious packets overrunning buffers and from using file download to
explore your file system.
<p>Older versions of DoomLegacy should be eliminated from network
usage for security reasons.
With so many important bug fixes, there is no
reason to be using older DoomLegacy for network play.
<p>Each client should ideally run the same version of DoomLegacy as the server.
Otherwise, some slight play difference may get them kicked due to
consistency failure.
  </dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>As soon as I add a bot to the game, the other players are kicked
with a consistency error message.  Is there a way to have bots in a
network game?
  </dt>
  <dd>
Bots do not work with network games.  I do not know exactly why they
trigger consistency errors in the players.
<p>Bots were a new feature that was being worked on by other
team members.
Being that they can only be activated by a obscure
console command, they may not be totally finished.
The bots might not be integrated with all DoomLegacy features either,
such as network play, splitplayer, and saving games.
<p>Making the bots compatible with network play is waiting until after
some other major enhancements are done.
Then the whole bot system will get re-worked, integrated, and finished.
