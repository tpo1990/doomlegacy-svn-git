<h2>Environment variables</h2>
<p>
  You can set the following environment variables to
  have additional control over Legacy behavior. None of them are
  required.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>DOOMWADDIR</b>: This environment variable defines a path where
    wad files are located. This way you can easily share your wad
    files between different programs.  It is searched before the
    current directory, and the wad directory list are searched.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>USER</b>: This variable contains your username, is used as the
    default value for your player name in multiplayer games.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>HOME</b>: This variable indicates your home directory.
    In the home directory Doom Legacy will create a legacy directory to store
    your config and savegame files.
    If this variable is not defined, a default legacy home directory will be
    checked for existing, or one created in the program directory.
    Failure to have a consistent HOME will lead to losing your config,
    and savegames will not be saved.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>UserProfile</b>: This variable is checked on Windows systems as
    a substitute for HOME, if HOME is not defined.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Install General Instructions</h2>

<h3>Install Requires:</h3>
<nl>
<li>Doom Legacy executable.
<p>This may be obtained as a package
download, or may be compiled from source.
The binary download package may have a script or batch file to install
the binary.
<p>The Doom Legacy source is in the source package. 
The source package Makefile has an install for the compiled
executables, docs, and legacy.wad.

<li>The legacy.wad file.
<p>The legacy.wad is in the legacy common download package package,
along with these docs.
The legacy common may have a script or batch file to install it.
<p>The legacy.wad file contains fonts and graphics to run the Doom Legacy menu
system.
<p>The search for the legacy.wad file goes through the program directory,
the program wads directory, and the list of wad directories.
There is also a LEGACYWADDIR option that can be specified at compile
time, which provides an additional directory to look in for the
legacy.wad file.  This will be used for Mac Frameworks packaging.
</p>
<p>Do not hide the <b>legacy.wad</b> file in a subdirectory.
Subdirectories will NOT be searched.
</p>

<li>SDL library.
<p>The SDL library is required for the SDL build of Doom Legacy.  Linux
users are expected to install the SDL library as a system resource.
<p>Doom Legacy uses SDL 1.2.
<p>The SDL binaries have an SDL library included, for those users who
do not have SDL already installed.  If your system does not already
have SDL libraries or have older SDL libraries, then these library
files need to be installed with the Doom Legacy executable.
<p>For Windows users who do not install such libraries system wide,
the SDL libraries will need to be installed with the executable.
<p>The install script may try to do this itself.  If it fails to detect
the situation correctly, manual installation of the SDL libraries may
be required.  They just need to be moved or copied to the Doom Legacy
program directory.
<p>There are other compile options that do not use SDL, such as
DOS_NATIVE, WIN_NATIVE, and LINUX_X11.
The SDL libraries are not needed for such Doom ports.
Other special libraries may be required to be installed.
See the make_options file for compiling your port.
</p>

<li>A Doom IWAD.
<p>The Doom IWAD can be one of the Id Games Doom wads (which are
still under copyright) such as Doom, DoomII, Plutonia, TNT, or Heretic.
A free IWAD such as FreeDoom can also be used.
<p>These IWAD should be in one of the Doom Legacy wad search directories.
Any or all of the directories can contain wad files.
The IWAD can also be specified explicitly on the command line, or
launcher, but that becomes cumbersome.
<p>An IWAD search started from the "-game" switch,
will search 3 subdirectories deep, looking for a known IWAD name.
See GAME_SEARCH_DEPTH in doomdef.h.
<p>An IWAD search started from the "-iwad" switch,
will search 5 subdirectories deep.
See IWAD_SEARCH_DEPTH in doomdef.h.
The depth is limited to control disk rattling on mistyped names.
</p>

<h3>Linux Install Notes</h3>
<p>
  The installation location is flexible, and can be moved.
  The installation directory can be one that all players can use,
  such as <b>/usr/local/games/doomlegacy</b>.
</p>
<p>
  To manually install, unpack the tar file contents in the installation
  directory.
  The installation directory needs to include the
  doomlegacy binary, and legacy.wad.
  The tar file will also install the Doom Legacy docs there.
  The installation directory can also contain an autoexec.cfg file,
  that can execute Doom Legacy commands upon every Doom Legacy startup.
</p>
<p>
  The IWAD files should go in a separate directory that can be shared
  between all Doom source ports (such as
  <b>/usr/local/share/games/doomwads</b>).
  The list of directories will be searched for the IWAD file.
  This list is specified for each operating system in the doomdef.h file.
  Most of the directories searched are system directories, and some user
  directories.
  Wads that are specific to Doom Legacy can be put in one of the
  directories that is unique to Doom Legacy.
</p>
<p>
  The <b>DOOMWADDIR</b> environment variable can be set to point to another
  directory, in a login script or a game starting script.
  This environment variable was used by some other ports to specify
  the Doom wads directory.  The DOOMWADDIR directory will be searched
  before the list.
  The current directory, and a wads directory of the
  program directory are also searched before the list.
</p>
<p>
  Specify the verbose flag on the command line, <b>"-v"</b>,
  to see the search list, and other directories.  It is shown on the
  console, and to stderr.
</p>
<p>
  You can also make soft links in the above mentioned IWAD directory to
  point to the actual IWAD files.
  The valid IWAD file names for each games selection can be found in
  docs/technical/wad_selection.txt.
</p>
<div class="code">$ ln -s wads/idgames/doom1.wad  doom1.wad
$ ln -s wads/idgames/doom2.wad  doom2.wad
$ ln -s wads/idgames/doomu.wad  doomu.wad
$ ln -s wads/idgames/plutonia.wad  plutonia.wad
$ ln -s wads/idgames/tnt.wad  tnt.wad
$ ln -s wads/freedoom-iwad-0.7/doom2.wad  freedoom.wad
$ ln -s wads/freedoom-iwad-0.9/freedoom2.wad  freedoom2.wad
</div>
<p>
  Doom Legacy will use the <b>HOME</b> environment variable, which is
  usually set by your Linux login, to find your home directory.
  There it will make a hidden directory named <b>.doomlegacy</b> for
  storing your configuration files and saved games.
  If <b>HOME</b> is not set, Doom Legacy will try to find an alternate
  home directory.
  First it will try to find a user created
  <b>"legacyhome"</b>
  in the current directory.
  If that fails it will try to create
  <b>"legacyhome"</b>
  in the program directory.
</p>
<p>
  This behavior can be overridden by using the -home and -config switches:
<div class="code">$ doomlegacy -home ~/doomstuff -game plutonia
$ doomlegacy -home ~/doom -config ~/doom/plutconfig.cfg -game plutonia
</div>
<p>
  PWAD and DeHackEd files can be included using the -file switch. Examples:
</p>
<div class="code">$ doomlegacy -game tnt
$ doomlegacy -game plutonia -file pwad/pl2/PL2.WAD
$ doomlegacy -iwad freedoom.wad -file new_map13.wad
$ doomlegacy -file pwad/Twilight/TWILIGHT.DEH pwad/Twilight/TWILIGHT.WAD
</div>
<p>
  Script files can also be used to start Doom Legacy:
</p>
<div class="code">#!/bin/sh
cd /usr/local/games/legacy/
USER="Shotgun-wizard"
DOOMWADDIR=wads
doomlegacy -iwad doom2.wad -file DM8.WAD
</div>

<h2>FreeBSD, Solaris</h2>

<h3>FreeBSD Install Notes</h3>
<p>
FreeBSD, Solaris, and the other similar operating systems use the LINUX
install and operating instructions.
</p>

<p>
If there is some unique code for these operating systems.  Should some
unique problem be discovered please notify the Doom Legacy team by way
of the SourceForge DoomLegacy project bug and request system.
These notes will then be updated appropriately.  If a solution is also
submitted the problem may even get fixed.
</p>


<h2>Windows</h2>

<p>There may be several install batch files present,
because of the various flavors of DOS and WINDOWS.
Choose one that fits your system the best.
Help specifics for that batch file are obtained by running it with no
parameters.

<p>The instructions here most closely follow the install for Win98.
Other flavors of Windows may have more options.

<h4>System Share Install</h4>
<div class="code">$ install_win  sys
</div>
<nl>
<li>The executable, legacy.wad, and docs
are installed in the Program Files directory.
<li>The wads directory is outside that file structure. 
</nl>
<pre>
INSTALL_DIR =  "\Program Files\doomlegacy"
INSTALL_WADS = "\doomwads"
</pre>

<h4>Games Share Install</h4>
<p>Games Share install is not available for Windows.  Use Games install.

<h4>Games Install</h4>
<div class="code">$ install_win  games
$ INSTALL_WIN  games  d:
</div>
<nl>
<li>A hard drive letter or other prefix may be specified as the second
parameter.
<li>The executable, legacy.wad, and docs
are installed in the Program Files directory.
<li>There is a wads subdirectory, mostly for legacy specific wads.
<lib>Other, generic wads directories, will also be searched.
</nl>
<pre>
INSTALL_DIR = \games\doomlegacy
INSTALL_WADS = %INSTALL_DIR%\wads
</pre>

<h4>User Install</h4>
<div class="code">$ install_win  user
$ INSTALL_WIN  user  my_doom_directory
</div>
<nl>
<li>The user directory may be specified.
<li>The default user install directory is "games/doomlegacy" in the
user directory.
</nl>
<pre>
INSTALL_BIN_DIR="$HOME/games/doomlegacy"
</pre>

<h4>Search directories in Windows</h4>
<p>To change, edit source file doomdef.h, and re-compile.
<br>Other directories can be added to doomdef.h, with up to 21 search directories.
<br>The tilde is converted to $HOME by Doom Legacy.
<br>Where PROGDIR is the program directory, and DEFDIR is the current directory.

<h4>Search for legacy.wad:</h4>
<nl>
<li><b>"PROGDIR"</b>
<li><b>LEGACYWADDIR</b>
<li><b>"PROGDIR\wads"</b>
<li><b>wad search directory list</b>
</nl>

<h4>Search order, IWAD:</h4>
<nl>
<li><b>DOOMWADDIR</b>
<li><b>"DEFDIR"</b>
<li><b>"PROGDIR\wads"</b>
<li><b>"~\games\doom"</b>
<li><b>"~\games\doomwads"</b>
<li><b>"~\games\doomlegacy\wads"</b>
<li><b>"\doomwads"</b>
<li><b>"\games\doomwads"</b>
<li><b>"\games\doom"</b>
<li><b>"\Program Files\doomlegacy\wads"</b>
<li><b>"PROGDIR"</b>
</nl>


<h3>Windows Install Notes</h3>

<p>
  The search directories for Windows are not as extensive as other ports.
  If the legacy.wad and IWAD are installed within these directories it
  should be possible to execute Doom Legacy without having to switch to
  the executable first.
</p>
<p>
  If there is difficulty, it may be required to move files to a known
  location, or edit the doomdef.h file to customize a search directory.
  Support files, like wads, <b>legacy.wad</b>, <b>autoexec.cfg</b>,
  and <b>config.cfg</b>,
  need to be found by Doom Legacy
  and it is not reliable to look in the current directory for these.
  Users commonly would lose their config file because they had not set HOME,
  did not know where their config went, or Doom Legacy could not find
  a HOME to store config and savegames.
</p>
<p>
  Put your wad files in directory <b>"\doomwads"</b>, or <b>"\games\doomwads"</b>,
  or in the current directory.  Doom Legacy will search all doomwaddir 
  for the wad file.
  The environment variable <b>DOOMWADDIR</b> can be set in a batch file to
  specify a different wad directory.  Other doom ports commonly used that
  environment variable to point to the doom wad directory.
</p>
<p>
  A <b>"legacy"</b> or <b>"doomlegacy"</b> directory will be created in your
  home directory for savegames and saved config files.
  This depends upon determining the HOME directory at run-time.
  This is commonly done with a UserProfile or HOME environment variable set
  at user login to the operating system.
</p>
<p>
  For Windows, Doom Legacy first looks for the HOME directory in the
  "<b>HOME</b>" environment variable, and then in the
  "<b>UserProfile</b>" environment variable.
</p>
<p>
  If HOME (or UserProfile), is not set by system login then it should be set
  by the user.
  Set the environment variable "<b>HOME</b>" in a batch file,
  or use the -home switch when starting Doom Legacy.
  If <b>HOME</b> is not set, Doom Legacy will try to find an alternate
  home directory.
  First it will try to find a user created
  <b>"legacyhome"</b>
  in the current directory.
  If that fails it will try to create
  <b>"legacyhome"</b>
  in the program directory.
</p>
<p>
  Overriding by using the -home and -config switches, examples:
</p>
<div class="code">> doomlegacy -home c:\games\doomsave -game plutonia
> doomlegacy -home c:\games\doomsave -config c:\games\plutconfig.cfg -game plutonia
</div>
<p>
  Use the verbose switch -v, and Doom Legacy will print to <b>stderr</b>
  the directory names that it used.  On Win98 this becomes a file
  named <b>stderr.txt</b>.
  The use of directory names with spaces may fail.
</p>
<p>
  It is difficult to start a program under windows and set command line switches.
  Most of the settings that the launcher supported can now be set from menus and the console.
  However the -game, -file, and -config must be set from command line switches.
</p>
<p>
  Doomlegacy will invoke a Launcher window when it is started without
  switches.  It will also invoke the Launcher window when the game
  selection results or iwad selection are invalid.
  The Launcher window provides input of the game switches, iwad,
  config, home, and doomwad directories.
</p>
<p>
  Another way to start Doom Legacy is to create shortcuts.
  These can be executed using a mouse.
  Specify in the shortcut the command line, and change the starting directory
  to where the doomlegacy program resides.
</p>
<div class="code">Example shortcut for Doom Legacy with plutonia2 wad:
Shortcut: dl_plut2
  command: doomlegacy -game plutonia -file c:\games\pl2\PL2.WAD
  current directory: c:\games\legacydir
</div>
<p>
  Creating a batch file with the necessary commands is also an easy way
  to record a combination of switches.  Run the batch file to start doomlegacy
  with the particular game and PWAD.
  In the following batch file examples, legacydir, homedir, configdir, and waddir stand for directories that you specify.
</p>
<div class="code">DOOM2.BAT
  cd c:\legacydir\
  doomlegacy -game doom2

DM8.BAT
  cd c:\legacydir\
  doomlegacy -iwad waddir\doom2.wad -home c:\homedir\ -config c:\homedir\config8.cfg

DM2MOD.BAT
  SET HOME=c:\games\home
  SET DOOMWADDIR=c:\games\wads
  cd c:\games\legacydir
  doomlegacy -game doom2 -file levl9.wad mod2.deh mod8.bex
</div>



<h2>DOS</h2>

<p>The DOS install is not as capable as other ports.
Because a binary download will not be available, it will have to be
compiled from Doom Legacy Source.

<p>This will require a compiler.<br>
Development used MinGW, but Watcom, and Clang have been tested.
The code does test for MS compilers, but their usage with a DOS
compile is unknown.
Only DOS_NATIVE compile is available.

<h4>System Share Install</h4>
<p>System Share install is not available for DOS.

<h4>Games Share Install</h4>
<p>Games Share install is not available for DOS.  Use Games install.

<h4>Games Install</h4>
<div class="code">$ INSTAL  games
$ INSTAL  games  d:
</div>
<nl>
<li>A hard drive letter or other prefix may be specified as the second
parameter.  It is used as a prefix on the games install dir.
<li>All executable, legacy.wad, and docs are installed to the games directory.
<li>There is a wads subdirectory, mostly for legacy specific wads.
<li>Other, generic wads directories, will also be searched.
</nl>
<pre>
INSTALL_DIR = \games\legacy
INSTALL_WADS = %INSTALL_DIR%\wads
</pre>

<h4>User Install</h4>
<div class="code">$ INSTAL  user

INSTALL_WADS = %INSTALL_DIR%\wads
</pre>

<h4>Search directories in DOS</h4>
<p>To change, edit source file doomdef.h, and re-compile.
<br>Other directories can be added to doomdef.h, with up to 21 search directories.
<br>The tilde is converted to $HOME by Doom Legacy.
<br>Where PROGDIR is the program directory, and DEFDIR is the current directory.

<h4>Search for legacy.wad:</h4>

<li><b>"PROGDIR"</b>
</nl>


<h3>DOS Install Notes</h3>

<p>Put IWAD files in some of the directories in the search list.
<p>See the Windows install notes, as the situation is very much the same.

<p>
  A <b>"legacy"</b> directory will be created in your specified home directory
  for savegames and saved config files.
</p>
<p>
  Set the environment variable "<b>HOME</b>" in a batch file,
  or use the -home switch when starting Doom Legacy.
  If <b>HOME</b> is not set, Doom Legacy will try to find an alternate
  home directory.
  First it will try to find a user created
  <b>"DL_HOME"</b>
  in the current directory.
  If that fails it will try to create
  <b>"DL_HOME"</b>
  in the program directory.
  <br>
  This behavior can be overridden by using the -home and -config switches.
</p>
