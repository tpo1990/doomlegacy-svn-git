<h1>Map Editing</h1>
<h1 class="tagline">Getting Started Tutorial</h1>

<div class="column">
<p>
This tutorial explains how to create 2 rooms, a door, and a teleport using 
the Doom Builder map editor.
This tutorial assumes that you already have Doom Builder installed, configured 
properly and running. More info about Doom Builder and its configuration can 
be found on the Doom builder web site.
However, even if you're using a different editor, the concept of this tutorial 
is still the same.<br />
Let's get started.
</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<h3>Grid Rules</h3>
<p>
  First we need to examine our grid table.
  Like the grid, textures are usually laid out on grids in multiples of 8 unit 
  pixels, for example 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, and so on. Here's a visual:
</p>
<p><img src="images/demo/grid8.png" width="534" height="267" alt="" /><b>Flat Texture</b></p>

<p>
Doom editing has pretty much always been focused on an overhead or X,Y top 
view aspect.
We had to imagine our wall heights without seeing the grid, of course until 
Doom Builder's 3d Mode came along.
But as you can see the wall textures use the same grid rules as our floor and 
ceiling flat textures.
Here's a 128x128 door texture. And a 64x64 panel texture from Doom.</p>
<p><img src="images/demo/grid8_door.png" width="534" height="267" alt="" /><b>Wall Texture</b></p>

<p>
Now that you have a pretty good idea about the grid table, let's move
along.
</p>



<h2>First Room</h2>

<p>
In Doom Builder, Select Lines Mode.<br />
Now lets make a 256x256 Sector in the middle of our grid.<br />
It's floor height will be 0 and it's ceiling height will be
128. This will be our first room.
</p>
<p>
Next, Select Things Mode, and slap a Player 1 start in there.
It should look something like this:
</p>
<p><img src="images/demo/d1.png" width="604" height="301" alt="" /></p>
<hr />

<p>Now let's make another 256x256 Sector and a 32X128 Sector between them.<br />
  With the same floor and ceiling heights as before, 0 floor and 128 ceiling.</p>
<img src="images/demo/d2.png" width="604" height="301" alt="" />
<hr />

<h2>Creating a Door</h2>
<p>
This will be our other room and the door between them.
Now lets connect them, it should look something like this:</p>
<p><img src="images/demo/d3.png" width="604" height="301" alt="" /></p>
<hr />

<p>
Now to get our door to activate:<br />
Select Lines Mode.<br />
Select both of the door face Linedefs and Flip them so they will be pointing outward, 
this is done in Doom Builder by pressing the F key.<br />
Now while the Linedefs are still selected, Right click and add Linedef Action 
(114) and a Tag of 1.
</p>
<p>
<img src="images/demo/d4.png" width="604" height="301" alt="" />
</p>
<hr />

<p>
Now the door needs to be shut so our Linedefs will activate it
properly. Let's do that now.<br/>
Select Sectors Mode and Right click the door Sector.<br />
Set its Ceiling height to 0 so the door will be shut.<br />
Finally while the door Sector is still selected, give it a Tag of 1.
</p>
<p>
<img src="images/demo/d5.png" width="604" height="301" alt="" />
</p>
<hr />

<p>
Now let's start applying <b>textures</b> to our walls and door. 
Don't forget the Door track. :D<br/>
Speaking of door tracks, as it is, the door track <b>textures</b> 
will move. It's a personal preference but if you would like for them not to 
move, in <b>Lines Mode</b> select both door tracks and then Right 
click them, in the <b>Flags</b> area check the box: <b>Lower 
Unpegged</b>. Now those textures won't move anymore.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes it helps to change the lighting a bit in different areas 
of a map. I made one of my rooms a little brighter than the other.
After texturing, we should probably stop and test out our map. 
Have a go and make sure our door is working. ;)
</p>

<h2>Teleports</h2>

<p>
<b>Hey it works!</b>
But it's kind of boring, let's put a <b>teleport</b> 
in there to make things a bit more interesting.
</p>
<p>
Select <b>Lines Mode</b> and draw a 64x64 unit <b>Sector</b> 
in our second room.
Orientate the <b>Sector</b> so it fits in a <b>64x 
grid rule</b>. This way our <b>texture flat</b> won't look 
out of place.
Next <b>Flip</b> the <b>Linedefs</b> outward 
by pressing <b>F</b>, like we did with our door.
While the <b>Linedefs</b> are still selected, Right 
click them and add <b>Linedef Action (97)</b> and give them a <b>Tag</b> 
of <b>2</b>.
</p>
<p>
<img src="images/demo/d7.png" width="604" height="301" alt="" />
</p>
<hr />

<p>
Now that we have our first teleport made, we need to make a <b>destination 
teleport</b>.
</p>
<p>
Let's draw a small room in and connect it to our first room.
Make a 128x128 <b>Sector</b> and connect it to the room. 
It's always fun to teleport to a higher area in a map, so lets change the little 
rooms <b>floor height</b> to <b>64</b>.
Now lets draw our other teleport in, draw a 64x64 unit <b>Sector</b> 
into the little room.
Next and again, <b>Flip</b> its <b>Linedefs</b> by press <b>F</b>.
Now go into <b>Sectors Mode</b>, and Right click the 
new <b>teleport sector</b> in the little room, and give it a <b>Tag</b> 
of <b>2</b>.
</p>
<p>
<img src="images/demo/d8.png" width="604" height="301" alt="" />
</p>
<hr />

<p>
Now we should probably go ahead and apply some <b>textures</b> 
to our new structures in the map. Let's do that now.
Add your teleport <b>Texture Flats</b> in, and hey don't 
forget to apply the <b>Wall Texture</b> for the new little room.
</p>
<p>
Now we are almost ready to test out our teleport, but first! We 
need to add a <b>Teleport Destination Thing type</b>.
Let's do that now. Select <b>Things Mode</b> and add 
a <b>Teleport Destination</b>.
It should look like this:
</p>
<p>
<img src="images/demo/d9.png" width="604" height="301" alt="" />
</p>
<hr />

<p>
Ok now we're ready to go in-game and test it out.
</p>
<p>
Nice! it works perfectly. But it's missing something, that teleport needs to 
have a reason to be there.
Let's give it a reason, lets put a crate in there with an item to pick up!
</p>
<p>
Select Lines Mode and draw a 64x64 unit Sector in your first room and place 
it in front of the destination teleport.
Now go into Sectors Mode and Right click on the crate Sector. Set its sector 
Floor height to 64. Don't forget to texture it in!
Good, now lets place something on top of it. I put an Invisibility sphere on 
mine. :P
</p>
<p>
<img src="images/demo/d10.png" width="604" height="301" alt="" />
</p>
<hr />

<p>
Sweet, the teleport now has a reason behind it. But lets say we 
want to walk back into the teleport after we pickup our item.
Let's do that now.
</p>
<p>
Select the <b>4 Linedefs</b> of our current destination teleport.
Now like the first one, Right click the lines and add <b>Linedef 
Action (97)</b>, and give them a <b>Tag</b> of <b>3</b>.
Now, go into <b>Sector Mode</b> and select our first 
teleport sector, Right click and give it a <b>Tag</b> of <b>3</b>.
</p>
<p>
<img src="images/demo/d11.png" width="604" height="301" alt="" />
</p>
<hr />


<p>
Finally, put a <b>Teleport Destination Thing type</b> 
in our first teleport<b>.</b>
<b>Run the map and try it out!</b>
</p>
<p>
<img src="images/demo/d12.png" width="604" height="301" alt="" />
</p>
<hr />

<p>
Excellent work!
</p>
<p>
<img src="images/demo/d13.png" width="604" height="402" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
You have learned how to make 2 rooms connected by a door, 
and 2 teleports, each with their own destination!
</p>

<ul>
  <li>This tutorial has focused on connecting <b>Sectors</b>, <b>Linedef 
    Actions</b>, and <b>Tagging</b> them for effect, using</li>
  <li><b>Linedef Action (114)</b> = <b>Door Open wait Close Fast 
    S/R - Switchable/Repeatable</b></li>
  <li><b>Linedef Action (97)</b> = <b>Teleport W/R - Walkover/Repeatable</b></li>
</ul>
