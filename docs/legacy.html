<h2 id="intro">INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>  
  Hello all Doom fans of the world, welcome to the latest release of
  Doom Legacy!
</p>
<p>
  Since Doom was out we have been fans of deathmatching. Some of us
  are fans of coop play. And, single play is popular too.
  Don't ask us why, but we liked Doom more than Duke Nukem, Quake or other clones.
  We simply enjoy the atmosphere, look and feel of Doom.
</p>
<p>
  We always dreamed of Doom sources being released. How many days we
  spent talking about the features we'd put in it!
  In the middle of 1997 we heard a rumour that the Doom sources
  would be released. Some months later the miracle happened: In
  December 1997, id Software made the full source code of Doom public.
  A great number of open source projects have started around the sources
  since, and Doom Legacy is competing to be the best of the choices!
</p>
<p>
  Doom Legacy can play Doom, Boom, Marine's Best Friend (MBF), and Heretic maps.
  In addition to the original games by id Software and Raven Software,
  there are hundreds of free, fan-made maps available on the Internet.
  These maps are typically distributed as <b>PWAD</b> files, which are not
  fully self-contained.
  For each game you will also need the corresponding <b>IWAD</b> data file,
  which contains all the graphics, wall and floor textures,
  sounds, and music for that game. For example, if you want to play Doom II
  maps, you'll need the IWAD file doom2.wad, or one of the free replacements.
 </p>
 <p>
  Doom Legacy itself is free software, meaning that you can copy and
  distribute it without charge.
  The original Doom and Heretic IWAD files
  (doom.wad from Doom, doomu.wad from Ultimate Doom,
  doom2.wad from Doom2, tnt.wad or plutonia.wad from Final Doom,
  heretic.wad from Heretic) are still
  copyrighted products and available commercially.
</p>
<p>
  There are also some free replacement IWADs which can be used instead.
  <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/freedoom/">FreeDoom</a> (doom2.wad or freedoom.wad) is a free substitute for Doom2.
  I recommend freedoom-0.8 rather than the later versions, which are a different style.
  <a href="https://code.google.com/p/blasphemer/">Blasphemer</a>
  (heretic.wad) is a free substitute for Heretic, but it does
  not have monsters yet (it needs volunteers to work on it!).
  The Legacy engine will recognize and play Chexquest (chex.wad),
  Chexquest2, and Chexquest-Newmaps (newmaps.wad), but not Chexquest3.
</p>
<p>
  Legacy has implemented the fundamental and de-facto-standard <a href="http://doom.wikia.com/wiki/Boom">Boom</a>
  extensions, and the Marine's Best Friend (MBF) extensions.
  Legacy also has implemented among other things
  3D floors, swimmable water and other special effects using extended
  linedef codes, and supports the FraggleScript scripting language.
</p>
<p>
  To get started with Legacy, we recommend trying some of the following PWADs.
  These are a few selected examples that demonstrate some of the features that Doom Legacy provides.
  There are many more in the repositories, such as at
  <a href="http://www.doomworld.com">Doomworld</a>.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Demonstrations of new editing features:
    Legacy_3ddemo.wad and rainbowstar.wad
  </li>
  <li>
    Wads that use Legacy 3D floors:
    3DHorror.wad, phobia.wad, hth2.wad, Compound.wad, GRAIL2.WAD,
    nocturnus.wad, spone2.wad
  </li>
  <li>
    Wads that use the Legacy features to implement different capabilities:
    Twilight.wad (with Twilight.DEH), bspeek.wad (Blake Stone),
    nimrod.wad, NEWBOXE.WAD (boxing match)
  </li>
  <li>
    Wads (and DEH files) that alter the players, sounds, and attributes, to be something very different:
    Delirium.deh (patch file) or Delirim.wad,
    skinbots/Skins.wad (skins),
    99PLAYER.WAD (skins)
  </li>
  <li>
    Deathmatch wads:
    andydm1.wad, toxdm1.wad, MRPD3D.wad, MRQ3DM17.wad,
    sleeper.wad, shbullet.wad
  </li>
  <li>
    Chexquest sequel:
    Chexquest-newmaps.wad
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  We hope that this new release brings you a lot of enjoyment.
  Have fun!!
</p>
<p>-The Doom Legacy Team</p>

<h3>What's new</h3>
<p>
  See <a href="whatsnew.html">here</a> for the latest changes.
</p>

<h3>What's coming</h3>
<p>  
  We have planned other features. See our <a href="http://doomlegacy.sourceforge.net">website</a>.
</p>

  
<h2 id="install">INSTALL</h2>

<p>
  Installing Doom Legacy depends upon the operating system and the
user preferences:

A full explanation of the source packages install is in the
<a href=INSTALL.html>INSTALL</a> manual.
</p>
<h3>Preferences</h3>
Select one of install methods.  This will determine where the binary,
wads, and docs are installed.  In some cases a directory may be specified.

<h4>System Share Install</h4>
Install to a System executable directory, like "/usr/local/bin" or
"/Program Files".
The docs and wads are installed to a user share directory, like
"/usr/local/share/games/doomlegacy" or "c:/games".
The owner of the files will be privileged.

<h4>Games Share Install</h4>
Install the binary in the games directory, but wads and docs in a
system share directory, for use by all system users.
The default games directory is games/doomlegacy and the default share
directory .
The owner of the files will be privileged.
A directory may be specified.

<h4>Games Install</h4>
Install in the games directory, for use by all system users.
All components will be installed into the same games directory, which by
default is "/usr/local/games/doomlegacy" or "c:/games/doomlegacy".
The owner of the files will be privileged.
A specific directory may be specified.

<h4>User Install</h4>
Install for the use of the immediate user, owned by the immediate user.
The install directory must be within the user directory space.
The User may specify a directory.

<p>
Install Doom Legacy in its own directory.
Do not install Doom Legacy to your home directory.  Doom Legacy
will not search the home directory.
</p>


<h3>Linux</h3>
<p>
  The installation can be system-wide or just for the user.  Some wad
  files can also be installed system-wide.  These can be put into one of
  the system wad directories.
  The user can also keep private wad directories.
  All will be searched, see the search directory list in the
  <a href=INSTALL.html>INSTALL</a> manual.
</p>
<p>
  The IWAD files should go in a separate directory that can be shared
  between all Doom source ports (such as <b>/usr/local/share/games/doomwads</b>).
  You can set the <b>DOOMWADDIR</b> environment variable to point this directory in a login script or a game starting script.
  If <b>DOOMWADDIR</b> is not set, Doom Legacy will try the
  directories of the search list, and the installation directory.
</p>
<p>
  You can also make soft links one of the above mentioned directories to
  point to the actual IWAD files.
  The valid file names for each game selection can be found in
  docs/technical/wad_selection.txt.
</p>
<div class="code">$ ln -s wads/idgames/doom1.wad  doom1.wad
$ ln -s wads/idgames/doom2.wad  doom2.wad
$ ln -s wads/idgames/doomu.wad  doomu.wad
$ ln -s wads/idgames/plutonia.wad  plutonia.wad
$ ln -s wads/idgames/tnt.wad  tnt.wad
$ ln -s wads/freedoom-iwad-0.7/doom2.wad  freedoom.wad
$ ln -s wads/freedoom-iwad-0.9/freedoom2.wad  freedoom2.wad
</div>
<p>
  Doom Legacy will use the <b>HOME</b> environment variable, which is
  usually set by your Linux login, to find your home directory.
  It will make a hidden directory named <b>.doomlegacy</b> there for
  storing your configuration files and saved games.
  If <b>HOME</b> is not set, Doom Legacy will look for
  <b>/usr/local/games/legacyhome</b>, and if that is not present then will
  use the current directory.
  This behavior can be overridden by using the -home and -config switches:
</p>
<div class="code">$ doomlegacy -home ~/doomstuff -game plutonia
$ doomlegacy -home ~/doom -config ~/doom/plutconfig.cfg -game plutonia
</div>
<p>
  PWAD and DeHackEd files can be included using the -file switch. Examples:
</p>
<div class="code">$ doomlegacy -game tnt
$ doomlegacy -game plutonia -file pwad/pl2/PL2.WAD
$ doomlegacy -iwad freedoom.wad -file new_map13.wad
$ doomlegacy -file pwad/Twilight/TWILIGHT.DEH pwad/Twilight/TWILIGHT.WAD
</div>
<p>
  Script files can also be used to start Doom Legacy:
</p>
<div class="code">#!/bin/sh
cd /usr/local/games/legacy/
USER="Shotgun-wizard"
DOOMWADDIR=wads
doomlegacy -iwad doom2.wad -file DM8.WAD
</div>

<h3>Windows</h3>
<p>
  The installation can be system style, a games directory, or within the
  user home directory.
  Some wad files can be put into one of the absolute path wad directories,
  making them available to all users and all doom programs.
  The user can also keep private wad directories relative to HOME.
  All will be searched, see the search directory list in the
  <a href=INSTALL.html>INSTALL</a> manual.
<p>
  The installation should put all files in known directories, which
  makes it easy to start Doom Legacy without needing to change to the
  program directory.
  If there is difficulty, it will be due to Doom Legacy not finding your
  HOME directory, not finding where legacy.wad is stored, or not finding
  the IWAD.  Ensure there is a consistent HOME directory to use the same
  config file each time you play.
  Put the needed files in known directories, and check that that the HOME or
  UserProfile environment variable is set to your home directory.
  When started with the "-v" switch, Doom Legacy will print to
  stderr.txt where it finds directories and the search list.
  Support files, like wads, legacy.wad, autoexec.cfg, and config.cfg,
  need to be found by Doom Legacy.
  The known directories are listed in the 
  <a href=INSTALL.html>INSTALL</a> manual.
</p>
<p>
  Put your wad files in known directories of the search list,
  like "\doomwads", or "\games\doomwads", or in the current directory.
  Doom Legacy will look in all directories of the search directory list.
  Setting DOOMWADDIR environment variable specifies an additional wad directory
  to be searched.  This can be set at login, or in a batch file that
  starts Doom Legacy.
</p>
<p>
  A "legacy" directory will be created in your home directory for savegames
  and saved config files.
  Set the environment variable "<b>HOME</b>" in a batch file, or use the -home switch
  when starting Doom Legacy.
  In Windows, "<b>UserProfile</b>" will be checked as an alternative to HOME.
  Otherwise, it will check for an alternative home directory exists,
  <b>"legacyhome"</b>.
  As a last resort, it will try to create <b>"legacyhome"</b> in the
  program directory.

  Overriding by using the -home and -config switches, examples:
</p>
<div class="code">> doomlegacy -home c:\games\doomsave -game plutonia
> doomlegacy -home c:\games\doomsave -config c:\games\plutconfig.cfg -game plutonia
</div>
<p>
  Use the verbose switch -v, and Doom Legacy will print to stderr the directory
  names that it used.  On Win98 this becomes a file named stderr.
  The use of directory names with spaces may fail.
</p>
<p>
  It is difficult to start a program under windows and set command line switches.
  Most of the settings that the launcher supported can now be set from menus and the console.
  However the -game, -file, and -config must be set from command line switches.
</p>
<p>
  Doomlegacy will invoke a Launcher window when it is started without
  switches.  It will also invoke the Launcher window when the game
  selection results or iwad selection are invalid.
  The Launcher window provides input of the game switches, iwad,
  config, home, and doomwad directories.
</p>
<p>
  Another way to start Doom Legacy is to create shortcuts.
  These can be executed using a mouse.
  Specify in the shortcut the command line, and change the starting directory
  to where the doomlegacy program resides.
</p>
<div class="code">Example shortcut for Doom Legacy with plutonia2 wad:
Shortcut: dl_plut2
  command: doomlegacy -game plutonia -file c:\games\pl2\PL2.WAD
  current directory: c:\games\legacydir
</div>
<p>
  Creating a batch file with the necessary commands is also an easy way
  to record a combination of switches.  Run the batch file to start doomlegacy
  with the particular game and PWAD.
  In the following batch file examples, legacydir, homedir, configdir, and waddir stand for directories that you specify.
</p>
<div class="code">DOOM2.BAT
  cd c:\legacydir\
  doomlegacy -game doom2

DM8.BAT
  cd c:\legacydir\
  doomlegacy -iwad waddir\doom2.wad -home c:\homedir\ -config c:\homedir\config8.cfg

DM2MOD.BAT
  SET HOME=c:\games\home
  SET DOOMWADDIR=c:\games\wads
  cd c:\games\legacydir
  doomlegacy -game doom2 -file levl9.wad mod2.deh mod8.bex
</div>


<h3>Windows with launcher</h3>
<p>
  The previous separate launcher is no longer actively supported,
  but older launchers will still work.  Other Launchers can also be used,
  as most command line switches are somewhat standard.
  Most of the settings that a launcher supports can now also be set from the
  console also, or using an autoexec file.
</p>
<p>
  The launcher has some problems with setting home and config directories.
  You will likely have to include
  "-config mydir\config.cfg", and/or "-home homedir" in options.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Unpack the archive to a suitable program directory,
      like <b>C:\games\doomlegacy</b></li>
  <li>Start the Launcher</li>
  <li>Fill in required information about WAD locations and hardware options</li>
  <li>Launch the game!</li>
</ul>

<h3>Environment variables</h3>
<p>
  The following environment variables alter Doom Legacy behavior.
  None of them are required.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>DOOMWADDIR</b>: This environment variable defines a path where
    wad files are located. This way you can easily share your wad
    files between different programs.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>USER</b>: This variable contains your username, is used as the
    default value for your player name in multiplayer games.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>HOME</b>: This variable indicates your home directory.
    In the home directory Doom Legacy will create a legacy directory to store
    your config and savegame files.
    If this variable is not defined, a default legacy home directory will be
    checked for existing, or one created in the program directory.
    Failure to have a consistent HOME will lead to losing your config,
    and savegames will not be saved.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>UserProfile</b>: This variable is checked on Windows systems as
    a substitute for HOME, if HOME is not defined.
  </li>
</ul>


<h3>Setting up the game</h3>
<p>
  Legacy uses a configuration file (config.cfg) to setup the game.
  Your personal control settings are saved in your config.cfg file.
  They can be changed by menus in Legacy, and are saved when quitting
  the game.
</p>
<p>
  When config.cfg does not exist, Legacy will write one using a default config.
</p>
<p>
  OpenGL uses a separate file, 'glconfig.cfg', so that the OpenGL
  settings do not disturb an existing config file. This does
  mean that switching to OpenGL requires setting up the controls again.
</p>
<p>
  Develop mode (-devgame or -devparm), will use devdataconfig.cfg
  as its config file.
</p>


<h3>Setting up the sound</h3>
The binary downloads of Doom Legacy use SDL sound.
The other options require downloading source code and compiling
with your own selection of compile options.
<ul>
<li>SDL
<p>
  In the SDL version of Legacy the SDL library handles sound. If it
  is installed correctly then Legacy will have sound effects.
</p>
<p>
  The latest SDL version is 1.2.15, and it fixes some earlier Win32 issues.
</p>
<p>
  Music requires SDL_mixer version 1.2.7 or later. Earlier SDL_mixer
  versions do not have a working RWOPS interface. Legacy can play music
  using files instead, but this requires recompiling Legacy, allowing
  the compile to detect the SDL_mixer version.
</p>
<p>
  SDL_mixer is a separate download and installation, and the latest is
  version 1.2.12.
</p>
</li>

<li>WINDOWS
<p>
  In the Windows native version the sound is autodetected using DirectX so make
  sure your card works well with DirectX and then legacy will use it.
</p>
<p>
  Additionally, Legacy could utilize hardware 3D sound
  for making more realistic sound environment.
</p>
<p>
  Specify -ds3d command line parameter to use generic 3D sound driver
  (DirectSound 3D). This driver are suitable for most 3D sound chips.
</p>
<p>
  FMOD is an alternative sound library.  To use FMOD, it must be compiled
  with the FMOD library and FMOD configuration selected.
  FMOD support was incompletely developed, so compilation has not been
  sucessfull. FMOD compilation is disabled by default.
</p>
</li>

<li>DOS
<p>
DOS support is still present, but it has been years since it has been
tested.  A more modern operating system provides better support.
</p>
<p>
  The sound and music card is auto-detected at the game startup.
</p>
<p>
  If you don't get any sound in Legacy, check that the BLASTER
  variable is set. Type 'set' at the dos prompt (or dosbox under
  Windows) : do you see a line like 'BLASTER=A220 I5 D1 ...' ?
  If not, run the installation of your soundcard for DOS mode,
  it will usually modify your autoexec.bat so that the BLASTER
  variable will be set. See the FAQ.TXT for more.
</p>
<p>
  If the BLASTER variable is set, but you still don't hear any
  sounds, or the sounds are not right, then edit the SOUND.CFG
  file, and manually set your type of soundcard, see there for
  more.
</p>
</li>
</ul>  

  
<h3>Setting up the controls</h3>
<p>
  Setting up the controls, mouse and joystick, video mode etc. is done
  while in the game, using the main game menus: Setup Controls,
  Video Options, Game Options. You can change all game settings
  at any time during the game.
</p>
<p>
  The mouse will be activated by default, to disable it, change
  the 'use_mouse' variable in the console.
  The joystick will not be used as default, set the 'use_joystick'
  variable at the console.
</p>
<p>
  The mouse and joystick sensitivities can be set
  using the console variables, and there is some menu support.
</p>


<h3>Setup Controls menu</h3>
<p>
  You can bind actions to one or two keys, like in all decent games.
  Select an action, press ENTER, and then press the desired key,
  mouse button, or joystick button.

  To CLEAR the keys attached to a control, use the BACKSPACE key.
</p>
<p>
  To setup the DOUBLE CLICK for mouse/joystick buttons: enter the
  click one time, so that it displays, e.g. 'MOUSEBUTTON1'. Then
  re-enter the click a second time, and it will transform into a
  dbl-click, e.g. 'MOUSEBUTTON1' will become 'DOUBLEMOUSE1'.

  You can use double-clicks for any joystick/mouse button, and you
  can attach any action to it.
</p>
<p>
  When controlperkey is "Several", a single key can be set to 
  multiple actions, e.g. go backward and 'use' at the same time.
  Normally when a key is set for an action, other uses of the
  same key are cleared.
</p>


<h3 id="gamma">Gamma controls</h3>
<p>
  The control of gamma is much finer than before. The gamma table is
  now generated from the control settings, instead of using
  four preset gamma tables.
</p>
<p>
  The gamma control functions:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Gamma: Only has a gamma slider</li>
  <li>Gamma_black: Gamma control and black level control.</li>
  <li>Gamma_bright_black: Gamma control, bright control, and black
    level control.</li>
  <li>Linear: Has bright and black level controls, as two set-points
    of piecewise linear brightness correction. It is included
    for use with LCD displays.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Controls for gamma function, black level, bright level, and gamma
  are on an options page. The values can also be changed by a
  console set command, or in your personal config.cfg file.
</p>
<div class="code">gammafunc Gamma_bright_black
black -2
gamma 2
bright -1</div>
<p>
  To see the current setting just type the name, without a value.
  Normal levels are black 0, gamma 0.
</p>
<p>
  To set the gamma correction to your preference,
  find a dark area in a wad or use the gamma.wad file
  (i.e. -file gamma.wad).
  Set the black level to give a good looking even gray scale in the
  darkest areas (little gray room in gamma.wad).
  White textures will not go completely to black, but will instead stay
  gray. The software renderer is limited to 32 light levels, so do not try to
  get it perfect in the darkest three gray test strips as it is not
  possible. Instead try to get the gray intervals even. You should be
  able to just barely see an object right in front of you in the darkest
  room, and see white textures across the room as a dark gray patch.
</p>
<p>
  Then go to a normally lit area and adjust gamma to give the
  brightness and evenness of tone that you would expect.
</p>
<p>
  Use the bright control to adjust the brightest outdoor scenes
  after the gamma and black levels are set. Unlike most monitors,
  this bright control actually controls the brightest light levels.
</p>
<p>
  Your preferences may be different. From experiments, trying too
  hard to set a perfect black leads to extreme gamma settings to correct
  for the side effects. It is a compromise, as actual hardware varies,
  and the gamma table equations represent ideal CRT behavior.
  LCD monitor gamma response is even less ideal.
</p>
<p>
  Evenness is usually more important than absolute brightness. The brightness
  appearance is affected greatly by the amount of light over your monitor.
  If the wall textures look harsh, then the gamma is set too high, or
  the black level is set too low.
</p>

<h2 id="gameplay">BASIC GAMEPLAY</h2>

<h3>Shooting up and down</h3>
<p>
  There's nothing changed, except of course a totally new
  deathmatch experience.
</p>
<p>
  About the BFG: the BFG ball can be fired up or down, but
  the invisible rays that spray from you have always 'autoaim', they're
  not dependent of your up and down aim.
  Let's be clear: apart from being able
  to shoot the BIG BFG BALL up or down, the side-effect of the BFG
  is as before.
</p>
  
<h3>Autoaim toggle</h3>
<p>
The original Doom games had autoaim, which allowed them to use the
mouse for player movement (forwards and back).  Side to side motion
turned the player.  This left the user without any way to move the view
up and down, so autoaim would aim the shots at monsters that were
above or below the aiming point.
</p>
<p>
DoomLegacy has mouselook, which uses the mouse to look left, right, up,
and down.  Shots go where the player is looking.  If you have the
crosshairs enabled, then it shows where shots are going.  With
mouselook, autoaim is not needed, so autoaim can be disabled.
</p>
<p>
  Since Legacy v1.2, there are controls for what is allowed in a network game.
  We wanted to keep the compatibility with the traditional Doom gameplay,
  but we also needed to go forward with improvements with controls,
  which brings more depth to the deathmatches.
</p>
<p>
  In network play, you may feel like it's unbalanced if some people use the autoaim,
  as they don't have to make the effort of aiming properly, and others
  manually aim, and thus may miss above or below the opposing player.
  Turning allowautoaim to OFF will impose manual aim to all players
  in a network game.  Use with caution as you may offend!!
</p>

<h3>Weapon changes</h3>
<p>
  We didn't dare of course change the existing weapons functionality!
  You may appreciate however, the fact that you can remap every
  weapon to any key, in the Setup Controls menu. Since you can map two
  keys per 'control', you can keep the original keys '1'-'8' for the
  weapons, and add a shortcut to your preferred ones. eg: '5' and 'r'
  for rockets.
</p>
  
<h3>New cheats</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>idcd##</dt>
  <dd>
    Similar to the 'idcmus##', but for CD Audio tracks.
    Example: 'idcd02' starts cd track 2.
  </dd>
  <dt>idfly</dt>
  <dd>Fly around levels, using the jump key to gain altitude.</dd>
</dl>

  
<h3>Savegame directories</h3>
<p>
  Legacy allows savegame directories, with up to 99 savegames in each
  directory. This feature can be enabled/disabled by a compile time
  option.
</p>
<p>
  The savegame file names include the level name and play time.
  The savegames also have a human-readable header with this and more
  information, including the command line switches used.
</p>
<p>
  The cursor movement keys are up-arrow, down-arrow, page-up, and page-down.<br/>
  The delete key will delete the selected savegame or directory.<br/>
</p>
<p>
  The savegame menus now include a directory name.
  The directory is selected by moving the cursor up to the directory name,
  and pressing ENTER. The menu will present all the existing directory
  names. The blank directory line is the legacy default directory
  which contains all the directories and savegames.
</p>
<p>
  To create a new directory, move to the directory line, press ENTER,
  type in a new directory name, and press ENTER.
</p>


<h3>OpenGL renderer</h3>
<p>
  Legacy includes two different graphics engines, the old Doom software
  renderer (with many improvements) and an OpenGL-based hardware renderer.
</p>
<p>
  The OpenGL renderer is shinier and has fancier effects than the software one,
  but it does not do everything that the software renderer does.
  It does have coronas, explosion light, and other light effects that the
  software renderer does not do.
</p>
<p>
  Some wads rely upon violating wad rules to get trick effects.
  Most rely upon tricking the software renderer into not drawing something.
  Using those wads with the OpenGL renderer you will see holes in the floor
  and ceiling, and warning messges about polygons.
</p>
<p>
  OpenGL relies upon having video card hardware acceleration.
  This requires that your video card drivers support OpenGL operations.
  Without OpenGL hardware acceleration, SDL will emulate the OpenGL operations
  using software run on your CPU, which is very very slow.
  How well a video card works with OpenGL is dependent upon the drivers.
  The SDL library interfaces with the video card drivers.  Updating
  your SDL library may improve the drawing, and fix broken features.
</p>
<p>
  Video cards have different levels of hardware acceleration,
  and rendering speed.
  Activate only as many fancy rendering options as your video card can
  draw fast.
  Turning off Trilinear and Bilinear filtering usually will gain speed.

<h2 id="console">CONSOLE</h2>
<p> 
See <a href="console.html">here</a> for more about the console.
</p>

  
<h2 id="network">NETWORK GAMES (MULTIPLAYER)</h2>
<p>  
  Since Legacy 1.2, the network part of Doom has been totally
  rewritten. It now uses a better transfer method for the packets,
  (which is usually faster), and also implements a basic
  Client/Server model, where some critical game options are
  changeable only by the server in multiplayer games.
</p>
<p>
  Since the network communication is faster, we have upped
  the maximum number of players to 32!
</p>


<h3>Client/server model features</h3>
<p>
  The network code has been totally rewritten, here are the
  main features:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Players can join in while a game is in progress.
    No need to restart the game to add a new player.</li>
  <li>Up to 32 players in a game.</li>
  <li>
    The speed now depends on the server. If the server loses
    frames, all the other players will experience the slow down.
    Thus, make sure that the server has a good internet connection and
    runs smooth.
    You may want to run the server with a lower resolution graphics
    mode, to reduce its load.
  </li>
  <li>
    The server can kick any player out of the game. The player will
    be returned to the title screen.
  </li>
  <li>
    Consistency failure now only kicks out the player who was not
    consistent with the server.  The other players are not affected.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="console.html#game_options">Critical game variables</a>
    are sent to all the players when they
    are changed on the server, and only the server can change them.
    Examples are 'allowjump', 'respawnitemtime', 'deathmatch', ...
  </li>
</ul>


<h3>Setting up a network game</h3>
<p>
  A network game can be started either using the commandline
  parameters <a href="#cmd_network">-server</a>
  and <a href="#cmd_network">-connect</a>,
  or from the multiplayer menu that
  allows you to connect to a server or create one yourself.
</p>
<p>
  The Legacy server uses only one port (usually the UDP port 5029) and can accept messages from any
  port so it works perfectly with NAT (Network Address Translation).
<p>
  A firewall often interferes with connecting.
  Most of the IP ports of a computer behind a firewall are not
  visible to the network.
  You may have to use the firewall controls to make
  the DoomLegacy server and client ports visible on the networks.
  If you are playing network games with machines external to your
  network, then you will need to make your IP address, and Doom Legacy
  ports, visible to the external network.
  There may be multiple
  firewalls involved, such as one on your desktop, one on the wifi-router, and
  one in the broadband router.
  In some cases, the server might get an un-usable IP address during player join-game.
  If you are familiar with the IpAutoforward funtionality of Linux,
  you can make a usable IP appear.
</p>
<p>
  The server port can be specified using a command line switch "-udpport 5102".
  You must avoid any existing port your ISP may be using for services.
  Multiple Doom Legacy servers can coexist on the same network, playing
  separate games, as long as they use different server port numbers.
  If the server uses a different server port, then all clients that
  want to connect to that server, must also specify the same server port address (using -udpport).
  All the connect commands assume that the server and client have
  specified the same server port.
<p>The UDP ports, user reserved, start at 5000.
  For Doom Legacy, I recommend using a server port number greater than 5029,
  such as 5100 .. 5199,
  to avoid conflicts with other programs.
</p>

<h4>The server</h4>
<p>
  Start a server from the Multiplayer menu or from the command line.
  One player can play on the server itself.
</p>
<h4>Server command line switches</h4>
<p>
  Doom Legacy can start as a server from the command line with
  one of the following commands.  Other switches can also be
  included to select the game and wad.
</p>
<div class="code">$ doomlegacy -server &lt;num-of-players&gt;
</div>
<p>
  The server will wait until the specified number of players have
  connected and then will start the game. This is like the old way to
  start a game. It is more fair because all players start at the same
  time and with the same weapons. Of course other clients can also
  join later.
</p>
<div class="code">$ doomlegacy -server
</div>
<p>
  This starts the server immediately.  It does not wait for any other clients.
  It also starts the game immediately.  Other players can join later.
</p>
<h4>Clients</h4>
<p>
  Clients are the other players who join the game by connecting to the server.
  Each additional player connects to the server with one of the connect commands.
  If there is more than one server, the client must choose which server before connecting.
</p>
<p>
  The client can specify a client port address, such as "-clientport 7303".
  Clients can use any port number that is unused on their IP address.
  If that port is in use then Doom Legacy will try ports in the
  7000 to 7099 range, until it finds an unused one.
  This allows multiple clients on the same computer, assuming it has
  enough speed, controls, and displays.
  Players on separate computers can use the same client port addresses,
  as they will have different IP addresses.
  In most cases the default client port works fine.
</p>
<p>
  The server does not use the client port number setup.
  The server will get the IP address and client port number
  for each player from the client connect message.
</p>
<p>
  To detect servers on the local network, the local network search
  address must be specified in one of the server config vars, server1,
  server2, or server3.  These can be set using the console.
  Your computer might have an IP address such as "192.168.1.14".
  For a network would be "192.168.1".
  The network broadcast address is the network address with last number as 255.
  Doom Legacy servers on the network will answer the broadcast.
</p>
<div class="code"> >server2 "192.168.1.255"
</div>

<p>
  Servers can be specified by any of the config vars, server1, server2, or
  server3.  The address is checked for a running server.
</p>
<div class="code"> >server1 "10.42.22.63"
</div>
  
<h4>Client command line switches</h4>
<p>
  Doom Legacy can connect to the server from the command line with
  one of the following connect commands.
</p>
<p>
  To connect to a specific server computer using their ip address.
</p>
<div class="code">$ doomlegacy -connect &lt;ip address of server&gt;
</div>
<p>
  Without the ip address, it will auto-detect the server on the LAN.
  This only works when computers are directly connected on a LAN where
  the client can broadcast an ASKINFO message to the server port.
  If you play through
  internet, only the servers on a local internet can be auto-detected.
</p>
<div class="code">$ doomlegacy -connect
</div>
<br>
<div class="code">Example A, 3 players on a LAN:
  player 1 (the server)
  $ doomlegacy -server 3

  player 2 (client)
  $ doomlegacy -connect

  player 3 (client)
  $ doomlegacy -connect

Example B, 2 players, through internet:

  player 1 (the server)
  $ doomlegacy -server 2

  player 2 (client)
  $ doomlegacy -connect xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx

Example C, a 3 player game, with _TWO_ computers, one is split-screen:

  player 1 (the server)
  $ doomlegacy -server 3

  player 2 and 3 (2 clients on the same computer)
  $ doomlegacy -splitscreen -connect
</div>
  
<p>
  The server will send the clients all relevant game parameters, they
  do not need to be specified on the commandline (and in fact would be overridden).
  Also the <b>-file</b> parameter is not needed on the clients
  anymore. The clients will automatically download any necessary PWAD files
  from the server if they cannot be found locally.
</p>

<p>
  Use '-notime' to disable file date check on clients. Normally
  the game will warn you if a client has a file loaded by the
  server, but with a different date. Clients should have the exact
  same version of the files added by the server.
</p>

<p>
  To make a network game enjoyable you will need a good ping value,
  ideally less than 30, more than this may be unplayable because
  there is not, for the moment, code to reduce the latency between
  command entered at keyboard and command execution.
  In other words, Doom Legacy doesn't use interpolation to make
  the game smooth when it is not in reality.
</p>


<h4>Consistency</h4>

<p>The Doom Legacy server performs a consistency check on the player
positions.  If it detects a consistency failure, it will kick out the
player.
</p>
<p>Doom Legacy 1.46.2 introduced consistency repair.
The server now keeps a consistency error count for each node.
Upon detecting a consistency error with a node, the server will try a
series of escalating repair attempts before it kicks the node out of the game.
<ul>
<li>Server sends a repair message with the player current position, momentum,
the random number index, and the current tick.  This is usually
adequate to repair a minor anomoly, or math difference.
</li>
<li>At 3 consistency errors, the server repair message suggests a savegame.
The client requests a savegame download from the server,
and then a position update.  The client screen will briefly go black
duing the download.  Because the game does not pause during this, the
player may find they have been mobbed and even killed.
</li>
<li>When the consistency errors exceed 7, the server kicks the player node.
</li>
<li>The server reduces the consistency error count when there are no errors.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Due to new network messages, and messages that changed codes,
Doom Legacy 1.47.2 is network incompatible with previous versions of DoomLegacy.
</p>



<h3>Multiplayer intermission screen</h3>

<ul>
  <li>FRAGS: the usual frags rankings</li>
  <li>
  BUCHHOLZ: a chess scoring system. You earn more points
  when you frag a good player (one that has a lot of frags at the end
  of the game).
  This is more balanced that the original frags system, because
  you can't get a good score simply by slaughtering clueless newbies.
<p>
  If player i has fragged player j F[i][j] times,
  the total frags of player i are given by T[i] = sum_j F[i][j].
  The Buchholz score of player i is sum_j F[i][j] * T[j].
</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  INDIVIDUAL: the players are all compared 1 to 1, when a
  player wins he earns 3 points, if they draw they each
  get 1 point. Then all the points are added and the
  winner is the one with the most points. This was
  suggested by Cristian Romero (romero-c@usa.net).
  Is is not perfect, but is already interesting enough:
  think of it more 'individual'. You have to make more frags
  compared to each other player to earn points. So you will
  want to go after players that you can make more frags, and
  forget about the ones which have already too much frags
  compared to you. Go for the victories, more than the frags.
  </li>
  <li>DEATHS: this ranking shows the players who have died the most!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="launcher">LAUNCHER</h2>

<p>
  The Launcher window is invoked when there is an error with the game
  selection, the iwad specified cannot be loaded, there is a fatal error
  in the startup, or if the command line is empty.
</p>
<p>
  If there is an error, the console window will display first with
  the errors.  Pressing escape will proceed to the Launcher window.
</p>
<p>
  The Launcher window has input lines like a menu.  Use the up and
  down arrow to move between items.  Type in names for the directories,
  or use backspace to erase names.  On the switches line the entire switch
  syntax must be input, on the others only the name is input.
  The left and right arrows will cycle through the game selections.
  When you are satisfied, the continue entry will
  restart Doom Legacy with your new command line input submitted.
  The QUIT entry will exit Doom Legacy entirely.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>HOME: Set your home directory location, where your config files and
    savegames are kept.
    This will be submitted by the launcher using the "-home" switch.
    <br>Example: "myhome", which will be submitted as "-home myhome".
  </li>
  <li>DOOMWADDIR: A directory to search for legacy.wad, IWAD, and PWAD files.
  </li>
  <li>CONFIG: The config file to use.
  This will be submitted by the launcher using the "-config" switch.
  <br>Example: "myconfig", which will be submitted as "-config myconfig".
  </li>
  <li>SWITCH: Any of the switches allowed on the command line, specified in
  the same format.
  This line will be simply copied to the command line by the launcher.
  <br>Example: "-opengl -nomusic -file map01.wad -deh fix2.deh".
  </li>
  <li>IWAD: A specific IWAD specified in place of the game IWAD.
  This will be submitted by the launcher using the "-iwad" switch.
  <br>Example: "myiwad", which will be submitted as "-iwad myiwad".
  </li>
  <li>GAME: The possible games, selected using the left and right arrow keys.
  This will be submitted by the launcher using the "-game" switch.
  <br>Example: "doom2", which will be submitted as "-game doom2".
  </li>
  <li>CONTINUE: Restart Doom Legacy with the new command line switches and
    selections.
  </li>
  <li>QUIT: Quit Doom Legacy entirely.
  </li>
</ul>

<tr>
<td id="mb">-mb &lt;number&gt;</td>
<td>The amount (in MiB) of memory that Legacy allocates for ZALLOC.
<p>
  Otherwise the default of 24 to 80 MiB is used.
  This and the MIN and MAX limits are set by compile time options.
</p>
<p>
  This sets the number of megabytes of memory to allocate to ZALLOC at
  Doom startup. ZALLOC is used for saving the directories, textures,
  and other lumps of the wad files. Executable and stack use other
  memory.
</p>
<p>
  If the amount of requested memory is not available, then it will try for
  half of what is free.
  There are several compile time options for ZALLOC memory allocation,
  the updated Zone allocation, automatic growing Zone allocation,
  and simple and tagged malloc allocations.
</p>
<p>
  The default memory allocator, GROW_ZONE, will grow the memory allocation
  when needed.
  It is no longer critical to set enough memory on the command line,
  although it may make loading smoother.
</p>
<p>
  Using this switch on the SWITCH line of the Doom Legacy Launcher is
  ineffective because the memory system has already started by then.
  However, Doom Legacy is compiled by default with the GROW_ZONE memory system,
  that automatically increases the memory allocation as needed, so it
  is not needed.  If you were to compile Doom Legacy with the old ZONE_ZALLOC
  memory system selected, then this switch would be necessary to control it.

<h3>DeHackEd patches</h3>
<p>  
  Doom Legacy supports dehacked patches directly, without having to
  patch the executable.  The original DeHackEd was an editor that would
  patch the Doom executable to change strings and monster behaviors.
  Doom Legacy will alter its own strings and monster behaviors to get
  similar, or better results.
</p>
<p>
  As of version 1.44, Legacy allows multiple changes to the same string.
  Later changes to a string will work, even when Legacy changes,
  language changes, Chex mode changes, or other deh files,
  have already changed the string.
</p>
<p>
  You can specify multiple .deh files using the -file option, and they
  will all be executed, in the order you have given them.
  Also, since version 1.30, Legacy will look for a lump named DEHACKED
  in each wad file and treat the contents as a dehacked patch.
</p>
<p>  
  We don't check for the dehacked patch version.  We added support for
  patches version 6.  It should run ok with (not too) old patches.
  If you have a problem with the version of the patch, try to convert it.
  Just load the .deh file into a recent version of Dehacked (3.0),
  and then save it again. It will then be saved as a text-file, that
  Legacy will be able to use.
</p>
<p>
  You can edit a .deh file manually and replace strings by larger strings than
  the original Doom strings, and it works.  The original Dehacked
  could not increase the length of a string, but Legacy can.
  Sprite renaming works too, well, pretty much anything works :)
</p>

<h3>BEX patches</h3>
<p>  
  Doom Legacy supports BEX, which is similar to dehacked but references
  changable attributes by a BEX name.
  BEX has more functionality and is more consise than DeHackEd.
  A BEX file can be provided using -file or -deh, and BEX can be in
  the DEHACKED lump.
  BEX is processed when BEX section names are encountered
  ("[STRINGS]", "[PARS]", "[CODEPTR]"), and will also handle INCLUDE.
