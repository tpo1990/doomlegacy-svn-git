MAKE_OPTIONS_PRESENT=1

# Select an OS: MAC
OS=MAC

# Select a draw library:
#  SDL: the SDL library is recommended and is the best maintained interface
#    The MAC SDL port is currently under re-development.
#  MACOS:
#    The MACOS port is old, and has not been tried in ages.
#    This is currently disabled, unless someone figures out how to compile it.
SMIF=SDL

# SDL_Mixer library is a separate library from SDL
HAVE_MIXER=1

# The MacIntosh operating system has some unique options.
# Mac compile using Linux SDL includes (MacPorts, Fink).
# MAC_FRAMEWORK uses the native Mac SDL setup.
# This needs work from someone who knows how to set this up properly.
# MAC_FRAMEWORK=1

# Put other options here, see the src/Makefile or README_compiling.
# Compiler select: GCC MINGW WATCOM CLANG
# CC_SELECT=GCC
# Enable CC_ENVIRONMENT to use the environment CC var.
# CC_ENVIRONMENT=1
# CC_EXPLICIT=clang
# To enable debug code, with no fullscreen.
# DEBUG=1

# Architecture custom compile will result in faster smaller code,
# but will not execute on incompatible machines.
# Any valid value for -march= on your compiler may be set here.
# For more information, ask your compiler.

# The default for GCC may be generic.

# Might not have the CD music libraries.
