# DoomLegacy Make options for DOS
# Copy this file to  make_options  and edit it to suit your preferences.
# See README_compiling.txt
# Edit for OS, SMIF, and other compile options.

MAKE_OPTIONS_PRESENT=1
# Select an OS: DOS WIN98
#   DOS: DJGPPDOS  Needs old libraries.
OS=DOS

# Select a draw library.
#  SDL: the SDL library is recommended and is the best maintained interface
#   but is not available for DOS.
#  WIN_NATIVE: Native windows (direct draw)
#  DOS_NATIVE: DOS native draw interface
SMIF=DOS_NATIVE

# SDL_Mixer library is a separate library from SDL
# HAVE_MIXER=1

# Put other options here, see the src/Makefile or README_compiling.
# Compiler option: GCC MINGW WATCOM CLANG
# CC_SELECT=GCC
# Enable CC_ENVIRONMENT to use the environment CC var.
# CC_ENVIRONMENT=1
# CC_EXPLICIT=clang

# Architecture custom compile will result in faster smaller code,
# but will not execute on incompatible machines.
# Any valid value for -march= on your compiler may be set here.
# For more information, ask your compiler.
# > gcc --target-help
# The default for GCC may be generic or i386.
# generic32, generic64, i386, i486, i586, i686
# pentium4, prescott, core, core2, athlon, k6, k8, amdfam10, etc.
# + mmx, sse, sse2, sse3, sse4, 3dnow
# Examples:
# ARCH=-march=i386
# ARCH=-march=i486+sse2
# ARCH=-march=i686 -mtune=athlon -msse
# Let the compiler detect your hardware.
# ARCH=-march=native

# To enable debug code, with no fullscreen.

# Might not have the CD music libraries.
