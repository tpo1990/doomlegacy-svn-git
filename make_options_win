# DoomLegacy Make options for Windows
# Copy this file to  make_options  and edit it to suit your preferences.
# See README_compiling.txt
# Edit for OS, SMIF, and other compile options.

MAKE_OPTIONS_PRESENT=1

# Select an OS:
#  WIN32: generic WIN32
#  WIN98: specific to WIN98 and such older Windows
#  WIN7:  specific to modern Windows.  Untested on modern systems.
#         This does  NOT YET  make a version customized to Win7/8.
OS=WIN32

# Select a draw library.
#  SDL: the SDL library is recommended and is the best maintained interface
#  WIN_NATIVE: Native windows (direct draw)
SMIF=SDL

# SDL_Mixer library is a separate library from SDL
HAVE_MIXER=1

# Put other options here, see the src/Makefile or README_compiling.
# Compiler select: GCC MINGW WATCOM CLANG
# CC_SELECT=GCC
# Enable CC_ENVIRONMENT to use the environment CC var.
# CC_ENVIRONMENT=1
# CC_EXPLICIT=clang

# Architecture custom compile will result in faster smaller code,
# but will not execute on incompatible machines.
# Any valid value for -march= on your compiler may be set here.
# For more information, ask your compiler.
# > gcc --target-help
# The default for GCC may be generic or i386.
# generic32, generic64, i386, i486, i586, i686
# pentium4, prescott, core, core2, athlon, k6, k8, amdfam10
# + mmx, sse, sse2, sse3, sse4, 3dnow
# Examples:
# ARCH=-march=i386
# ARCH=-march=i486+sse2
# ARCH=-march=athlon
# Multiple switches
# ARCH=-march=i686 -mtune=athlon -msse
# Let the compiler detect your hardware.
# ARCH=-march=native

# To enable debug code, with no fullscreen.
# DEBUG=1

# Might not have the CD music libraries.
# CD_MUSIC=0

# MINGW and WATCOM can have separate DD libraries
# Alternative directory to find ddraw.h and other includes.
# DDINC=-I\MINGW\MX80\include
# Alternative directory to find ddraw and other libs.
# DDLIB=-L\MINGW\MX80\lib

# For FMOD sound.  Can compile without FMOD.
# The code that uses FMOD seems incomplete, consider it a work in progress.
# HAVE_FMOD=1
# FMODINC="" alternative directory to find fmod.h and other includes
# FMODLIB="" alternative directory to find fmod libs

# If you have a slow computer you may want to try assembly, but the
# assembly code is not often updated with the latest improvements.
# USEASM=1

# Other Make compile vars can be overridden too, see Makefile.
